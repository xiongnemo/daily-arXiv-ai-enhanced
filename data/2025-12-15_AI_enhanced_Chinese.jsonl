In the present scenario, most of the energy sources are limited and have a greenhouse effect on the environment. Therefore, it is the need of the hour that the energy consumed by the cloud service providers must be reduced and it is a great challenge to the research community to develop energy-efficient algorithms. To design the same, some researchers tried to maximize the average resource utilization, whereas some researchers tried to minimize the makespan. However, they have not considered different types of resources that are present in the physical machines. In this paper, we propose a task scheduling algorithm, which tries to improve utilization of resources (like CPU, disk, I/O) explicitly, which in turn increases the utilization of active resources. For this, the proposed algorithm uses a fitness value, which is a function of CPU, disk and I/O utilization, and processing time of the task. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive simulations are performed on both proposed algorithm and existing algorithm MaxUtil using synthetic datasets. From the simulation results, it can be observed that the proposed algorithm is a better energy-efficient algorithm and consumes less energy than the MaxUtil algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We evaluate all schedulers using a controlled simulation of 1,000 AI jobs on a 64-GPU, 8-node cluster that includes a realistic mix of training, inference, and research workloads. Static baselines (FIFO, SJF, Shortest, Shortest-GPU) achieve 45 to 67% GPU utilization and 12.5 to 18.3 jobs per hour and experience severe starvation, with as many as 156 jobs waiting longer than 30 minutes.

To mitigate the memorization risk without compromising their task performance, we apply Differential Privacy (DP) to CodeLLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of DP in CodeLLMs. DP adds calibrated noise to the training process to protect individual data points while still allowing the model to learn useful patterns.

This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design.

More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images.

The key insight is that the data drift, which necessitates model retraining, often shows temporal and spatial correlations across nearby cameras. By identifying cameras that experience similar drift and retraining a shared model for them, ECCO can substantially reduce the associated compute and communication costs.

Furthermore, we detail a robust Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) pipeline that stabilizes training via difficulty-aware data filtering and mixed-policy trajectory reuse. Empirical results demonstrate that Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning achieves performance comparable to models with significantly larger parameter counts across mathematics, coding, and agentic benchmarks, offering the community a competitive open model and a practical blueprint for scaling reasoning capabilities under realistic compute constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

GitHub Actions is a popular CI/CD platform that enables project maintainers to create custom workflows -- collections of jobs composed of sequential steps -- using reusable components known as actions. Wary of the security risks introduced by fully-privileged actions, GitHub provides a job-level permission model for controlling workflow access to repository resources. Unfortunately, this model is too coarse-grained to reduce the attack surface pertaining to permission misuse attacks: All actions within a job share the same permissions granted to the job. This violates the principle of least privilege and can lead to broader software supply chain attacks, whenever a compromised action exploits the granted permissions to compromise the repository resources. In this paper, we present Granite, a runtime proxy-based system that enforces fine-grained permissions for GitHub Actions at the step-level granularity within a job. Granite transparently monitors requests made by JavaScript and composite actions during workflow execution and checks them against predefined step-level policies at runtime. We evaluate Granite in terms of compatibility, security, and performance overhead using a dataset of 500 workflows comprising 12,916 jobs from the most-starred GitHub repositories that use GitHub Actions. Our analysis reveals that 52.7% of the jobs can be protected by Granite against permission misuse attacks. We evaluate Granite on 20 top-starred repositories (63 actions, 58 workflows), validate attack prevention using 10 permission misuse attacks across 42 overprivileged jobs, and measure an average overhead of 55% (3.67 seconds) per job, concluding that Granite effectively reduces CI/CD attack surfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A plausible approach to protecting this metadata is to have senders post encrypted messages on a public bulletin board and receivers scan it for relevant messages. Oblivious message retrieval (OMR) leverages homomorphic encryption (HE) to improve user experience in this solution by delegating the scan to a resource-rich server while preserving privacy. A key process in OMR is the homomorphic detection of pertinent messages for the receiver from the bulletin board. It relies on a specialized matrix-vector multiplication algorithm, which involves extensive multiplications between ciphertext vectors and plaintext matrices, as well as homomorphic rotations. The computationally intensive nature of this process limits the practicality of OMR. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a hardware architecture to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplication algorithm. The building homomorphic operators in this algorithm are implemented using high-level synthesis, with design parameters for different parallelism levels. These operators are then deployed on a field-programmable gate array platform using an efficient design space exploration strategy to accelerate homomorphic matrix-vector multiplication.

In this work, we advance the study of adversarial inputs by introducing Super Suffixes, suffixes capable of overriding multiple alignment objectives across various models with different tokenization schemes. We demonstrate their effectiveness, along with our joint optimization technique, by successfully bypassing the protection mechanisms of Llama Prompt Guard 2 on five different text generation models for malicious text and code generation.

We show that the cosine similarity between the residual stream and certain concept directions serves as a distinctive fingerprint of model intent.
