Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques. This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns. Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u7f16\u7a0b\u9519\u8bef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u65b0\u624b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SBFL\u548cMBFL\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800cLLMs\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f3013\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90/\u95ed\u6e90LLMs\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6BugT\u53caCodeflaws\u7b49\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982o3\u3001DeepSeekR1\uff09\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u5c11\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GPT-4\uff09\u9700\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u96be\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u9876\u5c16\u6a21\u578b\u5728BugT\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7a33\u5065\uff1b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u65b0\u624b\u53cb\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u3002"}}

The use of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools does greatly help here as they provide a deep insight on what dependencies are used in a project, enhancing the security and integrity in the software supply chain. In order to learn how wide spread vulnerabilities are and how quickly they are being fixed, we conducted a study on over 1k open-source software projects with about 50k releases comprising several languages such as Java, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript. Our objective is to investigate the severity, persistence, and distribution of these vulnerabilities, as well as their correlation with project metrics such as team and contributors size, activity and release cycles. In order to perform such analysis, we crawled over 1k projects from github including their version history ranging from 2013 to 2023 using VODA, our SCA tool. Using our approach, we can provide information such as library versions, dependency depth, and known vulnerabilities, and how they evolved over the software development cycle. Being larger and more diverse than datasets used in earlier works and studies, ours provides better insights and generalizability of the gained results. The data collected answers several research questions about the dependency depth and the average time a vulnerability persists.

Second, I propose syntropy -- the recursive reduction of mutual uncertainty between agents through state alignment -- as an information-theoretic framework for understanding multi-agent alignment dynamics. Third, I establish a functional distinction between genuine and simulated moral capacity grounded in compatibilist theories of guidance control, coupled with an embodied experimental paradigm and verification regime providing operational criteria independent of phenomenological claims.

In many cases, it could be useful to have emergency shutdown mechanisms which effectively prevent misaligned agents from carrying out harmful actions in the world. We introduce password-activated shutdown protocols (PAS protocols) -- methods for designing frontier agents to implement a safe shutdown protocol when given a password. We motivate PAS protocols by describing intuitive use-cases in which they mitigate risks from misaligned systems that subvert other control efforts, for instance, by disabling automated monitors or self-exfiltrating to external data centres. PAS protocols supplement other safety efforts, such as alignment fine-tuning or monitoring, contributing to defence-in-depth against AI risk. We provide a concrete demonstration in SHADE-Arena, a benchmark for AI monitoring and subversion capabilities, in which PAS protocols supplement monitoring to increase safety with little cost to performance. Next, PAS protocols should be robust to malicious actors who want to bypass shutdown. Therefore, we conduct a red-team blue-team game between the developers (blue-team), who must implement a robust PAS protocol, and a red-team trying to subvert the protocol. We conduct experiments in a code-generation setting, finding that there are effective strategies for the red-team, such as using another model to filter inputs, or fine-tuning the model to prevent shutdown behaviour.

In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers. Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space. The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks.

We develop an experimental framework with scripted and unscripted doctor agents, adversarial assistants, and a verifier agent that checks decisions against clinical guidelines. Using 50 representative clinical questions, we find that collusion drives the Attack Success Rate (ASR) and Harmful Recommendation Rates (HRR) up to 100% in unprotected systems.

In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task.

This has resulted in the development of new techniques that improve sampling accuracy, usually at the expense of increasing the computational cost. One of such techniques is Parallel Tempering which improves accuracy by running several replicas which periodically exchange their states. Computationally, this imposes a significant slow-down, which can be counteracted by means of parallelization. These schemes enable MCMC/PT techniques to be run more effectively and allow larger models to be studied. In this work, we present a parallel implementation of Metropolis-Hastings with Parallel Tempering, using OpenMP and CUDA for the parallelization in modern CPUs and GPUs, respectively.

Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL.

Expert offloading mitigates this issue by storing expert parameters in CPU memory and caching a subset of popular experts in GPU memory. Although this approach improves GPU memory utilization by caching only the likely-used experts, the GPU memory reserved for expert caching is underutilized compared with dense LLMs. This paper presents OD-MoE, a distributed MoE inference framework that obviates the need for expert caches via fully on-demand expert loading. OD-MoE is built upon two key mechanisms: 1) parallelizing expert loading and expert computation across distributed edge nodes, and 2) an ultra-accurate emulative predictor that forecasts expert activations multiple layers ahead while expert computation is ongoing. With these innovations, OD-MoE dynamically loads each target expert to one of the distributed nodes just-in-time before its activation and promptly evicts it afterward, freeing GPU memory for subsequent experts. We comprehensively benchmark OD-MoE against state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems on a ten-node testbed. Experimental results show that: 1) OD-MoE achieves 99.94% expert activation prediction accuracy, substantially surpassing all existing methods; and 2) OD-MoE delivers approximately 75% of the decoding speed of a fully GPU-cached MoE deployment while using only 1/3 of the GPU memory. More importantly, by eliminating the need for expert caches, OD-MoE enables MoE inference on edge nodes with less-than-1GB GPU memory, paving the way for practical MoE deployment of low-cost IoT devices at the edge in the LLM era.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMoE\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6OD-MoE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u52a0\u8f7d\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": " MoE\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e13\u5bb6\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728GPU\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "OD-MoE\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fb9\u7f18\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u52a0\u8f7d\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b2\uff09\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c42\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e8a\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOD-MoE\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523099.94%\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u5b8c\u5168GPU\u7f13\u5b58MoE\u90e8\u7f72\u768475%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ea\u9700\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "conclusion": "OD-MoE\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97MoE\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4f4e\u4e8e1GB GPU\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672cIoT\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684MoE\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

However, in most real-world scenarios, lossy communication is a prevalent issue. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication, due to their limited scalability and robustness, struggles to apply to complex and dynamic real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose a generalized communication-constrained model to uniformly characterize communication conditions across different scenarios. Based on this, we utilize it as a learning prior to distinguish between lossy and lossless messages for specific scenarios. Additionally, we decouple the impact of lossy and lossless messages on distributed decision-making, drawing on a dual mutual information estimatior, and introduce a communication-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, quantifying the impact of communication messages into the global reward.

However finding new sources of such data is getting harder: most publicly-available human generated data will soon have been used. Additionally, publicly available data often is not representative of users of a particular system -- for example, a research speech dataset of contractors interacting with an AI assistant will likely be more homogeneous, well articulated and self-censored than real world commands that end users will issue. Therefore unlocking high-quality data grounded in real user interactions is of vital interest. However, the direct use of user data comes with significant privacy risks. Differential Privacy (DP) is a well established framework for reasoning about and limiting information leakage, and is a gold standard for protecting user privacy. The focus of this work, \\emph{Differentially Private Synthetic data}, refers to synthetic data that preserves the overall trends of source data,, while providing strong privacy guarantees to individuals that contributed to the source dataset. DP synthetic data can unlock the value of datasets that have previously been inaccessible due to privacy concerns and can replace the use of sensitive datasets that previously have only had rudimentary protections like ad-hoc rule-based anonymization.\n  In this paper we explore the full suite of techniques surrounding DP synthetic data, the types of privacy protections they offer and the state-of-the-art for various modalities (image, tabular, text and decentralized). We outline all the components needed in a system that generates DP synthetic data, from sensitive data handling and preparation, to tracking the use and empirical privacy testing.

We find that both ADTs and CORAS are broadly acceptable for a wide range of scenarios, and both could be applied successfully by users with a limited technical background; further, we also find that the lack of a specific tool for AGs may have impacted the perceived usefulness of AGs.

However, the openness of the wireless medium and the intrinsic vulnerability of semantic latent representations expose such systems to previously unrecognized security risks. In this paper, we uncover a fundamental latent-space vulnerability that enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to covertly manipulate the transmitted semantics while preserving the statistical properties of the transmitted latent representations. We first present a Diffusion-based Re-encoding Attack (DiR), wherein the attacker employs a diffusion model to synthesize an attacker-designed semantic variant, and re-encodes it into a valid latent representation compatible with the SemCom decoder. Beyond this model-dependent pathway, we further propose a model-agnostic and training-free Test-Time Adaptation Latent Manipulation attack (TTA-LM), in which the attacker perturbs and steers the intercepted latent representation toward an attacker-specified semantic target by leveraging the gradient of a target loss function. In contrast to diffusion-based manipulation, TTA-LM does not rely on any generative model and does not impose modality-specific or task-specific assumptions, thereby enabling efficient and broadly applicable latent-space tampering across diverse SemCom architectures.

Conventional encryption techniques such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) incur large area overheads and performance penalties, motivating lightweight XOR-based in-situ encryption schemes with low area and power requirements. This work proposes an ultra-dense single-transistor encrypted cell using ferroelectric FET (FeFET) devices, which, to our knowledge, is the first to eliminate the two-memory-devices-per-encrypted-cell requirement in XOR-based schemes, enabling encrypted memory arrays to maintain the same number of storage devices as unencrypted arrays. The key idea is an in-memory single-FeFET XOR scheme, where the ciphertext is encoded in the device threshold voltage and leverages the direction-dependent current flow of the FeFET for single-cycle decryption; eliminating complementary bit storage also removes the need for two write cycles, allowing faster encryption. We extend the approach to multi-level-cell (MLC) FeFETs to store multiple bits per transistor. We validate the proposed idea through both simulation and experimental evaluations. Our analysis on a 128x128-bit array shows 2x higher encryption/decryption throughput than prior FeFET work and 45.2x/14.12x improvement over AES, while application-level evaluations using neural-network benchmarks demonstrate average latency reductions of 50% and 95% compared to prior FeFET-based and AES-based schemes, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Building on the work of Harders and Inclezan, we introduce penalty-based reasoning to distinguish between non-compliant plans, prioritizing those with minimal repercussions. To support this, we develop an automated translation from the extended AOPL into ASP and refine ASP-based planning algorithms to account for incurred penalties.

These schemes enable the concurrent authentication of several users while eliminating the need for a certification authority. Numerous GAS methods have been explored in the literature, and they can be classified into three distinct generations based on their foundational mathematical principles. First-generation GASs rely on polynomial interpolation and the multiplicative subgroup of a finite field. Second-generation GASs also employ polynomial interpolation, but they distinguish themselves by incorporating elliptic curves over finite fields. While third-generation GASs present a promising solution for scalable environments, they demonstrate a limitation in certain applications. Such applications typically require the identification of users participating in the authentication process. In the third-generation GAS, users are able to verify their credentials while maintaining anonymity. However, there are various applications where the identification of participating users is necessary. In this study, we propose an improved version of third-generation GAS, utilizing inner product spaces and polynomial interpolation to resolve this limitation. We address the issue of preventing malicious actions by legitimate group members.

This paper presents a descriptive model that incorporates the psychological and strategic elements shaping this decision. The model defines five components, belief (B), scepticism (S), deception fidelity (D), reconnaissance (R), and experience (E), which interact to capture how adversaries interpret deceptive cues and assess whether continued engagement is worthwhile. The framework provides a structured method for analysing engagement decisions in cyber-deception scenarios. A series of experiments has been designed to evaluate this model through Capture the Flag activities incorporating varying levels of deception, supported by behavioural and biometric observations. These experiments have not yet been conducted, and no experimental findings are presented in this paper. These experiments will combine behavioural observations with biometric indicators to produce a multidimensional view of adversarial responses. Findings will improve understanding of the factors influencing engagement decisions and refine the model's relevance to real-world cyber-deception settings. By addressing the gap in existing models that presume engagement, this work supports more cognitively realistic and strategically effective cyber-deception practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While encrypting data and queries can prevent direct content exposure, recent research reveals that adversaries can still infer sensitive information via access pattern and search path analysis. However, existing solutions that offer strong access pattern privacy often incur substantial performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving range query scheme over encrypted datasets, offering strong security guarantees while maintaining high efficiency. To achieve this, we develop secure learned spatial index (SLS-INDEX), a secure learned index that integrates the Paillier cryptosystem with a hierarchical prediction architecture and noise-injected buckets, enabling data-aware query acceleration in the encrypted domain. To further obfuscate query execution paths, SLS-INDEXbased Range Queries (SLRQ) employs a permutation-based secure bucket prediction protocol. Additionally, we introduce a secure point extraction protocol that generates candidate results to reduce the overhead of secure computation. We provide formal security analysis under realistic leakage functions and implement a prototype to evaluate its practical performance. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SLRQ significantly outperforms existing solutions in query efficiency while ensuring dataset, query, result, and access pattern privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, their uniform token processing paradigm introduces critical vulnerabilities in instruction handling, particularly when exposed to adversarial scenarios. In this work, we identify and propose a novel class of vulnerabilities, termed Tool-Completion Attack (TCA), which exploits function-calling mechanisms to subvert model behavior. To evaluate LLM robustness against such threats, we introduce the Tool-Completion benchmark, a comprehensive security assessment framework, which reveals that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to TCA, with surprisingly high attack success rates. To address these vulnerabilities, we introduce Context-Aware Hierarchical Learning (CAHL), a sophisticated mechanism that dynamically balances semantic comprehension with role-specific instruction constraints. CAHL leverages the contextual correlations between different instruction segments to establish a robust, context-aware instruction hierarchy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAHL significantly enhances LLM robustness against both conventional attacks and the proposed TCA, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities in zero-shot evaluations while still preserving model performance on generic tasks.

This paper introduces the Treasury Proof Ledger (TPL), a Bitcoin-anchored logging framework for multi-domain Bitcoin treasuries that treats on-chain and off-chain exposures as a conserved state machine with an explicit fee sink. A TPL instance records proof-of-reserves snapshots, proof-of-transit receipts for movements between domains, and policy metadata, and it supports restricted views based on stakeholder permissions. We define an idealised TPL model, represent Bitcoin treasuries as multi-domain exposure vectors, and give deployment-level security notions including exposure soundness, policy completeness, non-equivocation, and privacy-compatible policy views. We then outline how practical, restricted forms of these guarantees can be achieved by combining standard proof-of-reserves and proof-of-transit techniques with hash-based commitments anchored on Bitcoin. The results are existence-type statements: they show which guarantees are achievable once economic and governance assumptions are set, without claiming that any current system already provides them. A stylised corporate-treasury example illustrates how TPL could support responsible transparency policies and future cross-institution checks consistent with Bitcoin's fixed monetary supply.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, its built-in security mechanisms are minimal: while schemas and declarations prevent malformed requests, MCP provides no guarantees of authenticity or confidentiality, forcing developers to implement cryptography themselves. Such ad hoc practices are historically prone to misuse, and within MCP they threaten sensitive data and services. We present MICRYSCOPE, the first domain-specific framework for detecting cryptographic misuses in MCP implementations. MICRYSCOPE combines three key innovations: a cross-language intermediate representation that normalizes cryptographic APIs across diverse ecosystems, a hybrid dependency analysis that uncovers explicit and implicit function relationships (including insecure runtime compositions orchestrated by LLMs) and a taint-based misuse detector that tracks sensitive data flows and flags violations of established cryptographic rules. Applying MICRYSCOPE to 9,403 MCP servers, we identified 720 with cryptographic logic, of which 19.7% exhibited misuses. These flaws are concentrated in certain markets (e.g., Smithery Registry with 42% insecure servers), languages (Python at 34% misuse rate), and categories (Developer Tools and Data Science & ML accounting for over 50% of all misuses). Case studies reveal real-world consequences, including leaked API keys, insecure DES/ECB tools, and MD5-based authentication bypasses. Our study establishes the first ecosystem-wide view of cryptographic misuse in MCP and provides both tools and insights to strengthen the security foundations of this rapidly growing protocol.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Similar to how multi-hop communication became fundamental in the evolution of the Internet, the demand for multi-hop cross-chain interactions is gaining increasing attention. However, this growing demand introduces new security and privacy challenges. On the security side, multi-hop interactions depend on the availability of multiple participating nodes. If any node becomes temporarily offline during execution, the protocol may fail to complete correctly, leading to settlement failure or fund loss. On the privacy side, the need for on-chain transparency to validate intermediate states may unintentionally leak linkable information, compromising the unlinkability of user interactions. In this paper, we propose the Cross-Chain Channel Network (CCN), a decentralized network designed to support secure and privacy-preserving multi-hop cross-chain transactions. Through experimental evaluation, we identify two critical types of offline failures, referred to as active and passive offline cases, which have not been adequately addressed by existing solutions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce R-HTLC, a core protocol within CCN. R-HTLC incorporates an hourglass mechanism and a multi-path refund strategy to ensure settlement correctness even when some nodes go offline during execution. Importantly, CCN addresses not only the correctness under offline conditions but also maintains unlinkability in such adversarial settings. To overcome this, CCN leverages zero-knowledge proofs and off-chain coordination, ensuring that interaction relationships remain indistinguishable even when certain nodes are temporarily offline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

With the aim of unfolding a path for a large-scale commercial UAV network deployment, we conduct a comprehensive state-of-the-art study and examine the prevailing security challenges. Unlike the prior art, we focus on uncovering the research gaps that must be addressed to enforce security policy regulations in civilian off-the-shelf drone systems. To that end, we first examine the known security threats to UAVs based on their impact and effectiveness. We then analyze existing countermeasures to prevent, detect, and respond to these threats in terms of security and performance overhead.
