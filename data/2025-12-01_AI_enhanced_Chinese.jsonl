Yet, these domains often demand hefty computational power, translating to substantial energy usage and potentially sidelining less robust computing systems. It's evident that we need an approach that is more encompassing, scalable, and eco-friendly for intelligent algorithm development and implementation. The strategy we present in this paper offers a compelling answer to these issues. We unveil a fresh framework that seamlessly melds high-performance cluster computing with intelligent algorithms, all within a blockchain infrastructure. This promotes both efficiency and a broad-based participation. At its core, our design integrates an evolved proof-of-work consensus process, which links computational efforts directly to rewards for producing blocks. This ensures both optimal resource use and participation from a wide spectrum of computational capacities. Additionally, our approach incorporates a dynamic 'trust rating' that evolves based on a track record of accurate block validations. This rating determines the likelihood of a node being chosen for block generation, creating a merit-based system that recognizes and rewards genuine and precise contributions. To level the playing field further, we suggest a statistical 'draw' system, allowing even less powerful nodes a chance to be part of the block creation process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u96c6\u7fa4\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u4e0e\u73af\u4fdd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u7b97\u6cd5\u9886\u57df\u56e0\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u6d88\u8017\u5de8\u5927\u80fd\u6e90\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u8fdb\u5316\u7248\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5171\u8bc6\u5904\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bc4\u7ea7\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u62bd\u7b7e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u5f97\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u4e5f\u80fd\u53c2\u4e0e\u5230\u533a\u5757\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u4ece\u5404\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u52a0\u5305\u5bb9\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u73af\u4fdd\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The proofs proceed through bidirectional simulations between $\\operatorname{AMP}_f$ and $\\operatorname{HO}_f$ via an intermediate model that captures this notion of silencing.

This paper examines the characteristics of metadata caches and argues that they inherently exhibit correlated references, even when the corresponding data accesses do not contain correlated references. The presence of correlated references reduces the effectiveness of cache replacement algorithms because these references are often mistakenly categorized as hot blocks. Clock2Q+ is specifically designed for metadata caches and has been implemented in vSAN and VDFS, two flagship storage products of VMware by Broadcom. Similar to S3-FIFO, Clock2Q+ uses three queues; however, Clock2Q+ introduces a correlation window in the Small FIFO queue, where blocks in this window do not set the reference bit. This simple enhancement allows Clock2Q+ to outperform state-of-the-art replacement algorithms. Compared to S3-FIFO, the second-best performing algorithm, Clock2Q+ achieves up to a 28.5% lower miss ratio on metadata traces. Clock2Q+ possesses the essential properties required for large-scale storage systems: it has low CPU overhead on cache hits, low memory overhead, scales efficiently to multiple CPUs, and is both easy to tune and implement.

They are nourished by collecting rich streams of data, raising privacy concerns around excessive collection of sensitive personal information. Privacy policies are the fundamental mechanism for informing users about data practices in modern information privacy paradigm. Although traditional web and mobile policies are well studied, the privacy policies of LLM providers, their LLM-specific content, and their evolution over time remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we present the first longitudinal empirical study of privacy policies for mainstream LLM providers worldwide. We curate a chronological dataset of 74 historical privacy policies and 115 supplemental privacy documents from 11 LLM providers across 5 countries up to August 2025, and extract over 3,000 sentence-level edits between consecutive policy versions. We compare LLM privacy policies to those of other software formats, propose a taxonomy tailored to LLM privacy policies, annotate policy edits and align them with a timeline of key LLM ecosystem events. Results show they are substantially longer, demand college-level reading ability, and remain highly vague. Our taxonomy analysis reveals patterns in how providers disclose LLM-specific practices and highlights regional disparities in coverage. Policy edits are concentrated in first-party data collection and international/specific-audience sections, and that product releases and regulatory actions are the primary drivers, shedding light on the status quo and the evolution of LLM privacy policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u8fdb\u884c\u7eb5\u5411\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u96c6\u6210\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u654f\u611f\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c65\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb611\u5bb6LLM\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u768474\u4e2a\u5386\u53f2\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u548c115\u4e2a\u8865\u5145\u9690\u79c1\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u7248\u672c\u8fdb\u884c3000\u591a\u4e2a\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "LLM\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u8f6f\u4ef6\u683c\u5f0f\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u66f4\u96be\uff08\u9700\u8981\u5927\u5b66\u6c34\u5e73\u9605\u8bfb\u80fd\u529b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u3002\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u4ea7\u54c1\u53d1\u5e03\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u884c\u52a8\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\u4e3b\u8981\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u548c\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86LLM\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u8df5\u62ab\u9732\u4e2d\u7684\u5730\u533a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation (\"boxes\"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a \"consistent group\", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem.", "AI": {"tldr":

Code refactoring plays a critical role in this transition by improving structural organization and optimizing performance. However, existing refactoring methods are limited in their ability to generalize across multiple programming languages and coding styles, as they often rely on manually crafted transformation rules. The objectives of this study are to (i) develop an Large Language Models (LLMs)-based framework capable of performing accurate and efficient code refactoring across multiple languages (C, C++, C#, Python, Java), (ii) investigate the impact of prompt engineering (Temperature, Different shot algorithm) and instruction fine-tuning on refactoring effectiveness, and (iii) evaluate the quality improvements (Compilability, Correctness, Distance, Similarity, Number of Lines, Token, Character, Cyclomatic Complexity) in refactored code through empirical metrics and human assessment. To accomplish these goals, we propose a fine-tuned prompt-engineering-based model combined with few-shot learning for multilingual code refactoring. Experimental results indicate that Java achieves the highest overall correctness up to 99.99% the 10-shot setting, records the highest average compilability of 94.78% compared to the original source code and maintains high similarity (Approx. 53-54%) and thus demonstrates a strong balance between structural modifications and semantic preservation. Python exhibits the lowest structural distance across all shots (Approx. 277-294) while achieving moderate similarity ( Approx. 44-48%) that indicates consistent and minimally disruptive refactoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94C\u3001C++\u3001C#\u3001Python\u548cJava\u7b49\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Java\u5728\u91cd\u6784\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u8bd1\u6027\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caPython\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u8ddd\u79bb\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u5236\u5b9a\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08\u8003\u5bdfTemperature\u3001\u4e0d\u540cshot\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u7f16\u8bd1\u6027\u3001\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u884c\u6570\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u76ee\u3001\u5b57\u7b26\u6570\u3001\u5708\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aJava\u572810-shot\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u53ef\u8fbe99.99%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u53ef\u7f16\u8bd1\u6027\u4e3a94.78%\uff0c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u7ea653-54%\uff1bPython\u5728\u6240\u6709shot\u4e0b\u7ed3\u6784\u8ddd\u79bb\u6700\u4f4e\uff08\u7ea6277-294\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e3a44-48%\u3002\u91cd\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8bc1\u5b9e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684LLM\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u91cd\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0cJava\u6574\u4f53\u91cd\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u6700\u4f73\uff0cPython\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001(MM)\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u533b\u5b66AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u533b\u5b66\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6709\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u548c\u878d\u5408\u5408\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5305\u542b\u533b\u5b66\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9MM\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8be5\u529f\u80fd\u5e76\u672a\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u9886\u57df\u7684MM\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u89e3\u9501\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66AI\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Business requirements and resource constraints often necessitate mixing different languages across replica sites. To facilitate the management of replicated data, modern software engineering practices integrate special-purpose replicated data libraries (RDLs) that provide read-write access to the data and ensure its synchronization. Irrespective of the implementation languages, an RDL typically uses a single language or offers bindings to a designated one. Hence, integrating existing RDLs in multilingual environments requires special-purpose code, whose software quality and performance characteristics are poorly understood.\n  AIMS: We aim to bridge this knowledge gap to understand the software quality and performance characteristics of RDL integration in multilingual environments.\n  METHOD: We conduct an empirical study of two key strategies for integrating RDLs in the context of multilingual replicated data systems: foreign-function interface (FFI) and a common data format (CDF); we measure and compare their respective software metrics and performance to understand their suitability for the task at hand.\n  RESULTS: Our results reveal that adopting CDF for cross-language interaction offers software quality, latency, memory consumption, and throughput advantages. We further validate our findings by (1) creating a CDF-based RDL for mixing compiled, interpreted, and managed languages; and (2) enhancing our RDL with plug-in extensibility that enables adding functionality in a single language while maintaining integration within a multilingual environment.\n  CONCLUSIONS: With modern distributed systems utilizing multiple languages, our findings provide novel insights for designing RDLs in multilingual replicated data systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u4e13\u7528\u590d\u5236\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff08RDLs\uff09\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5916\u90e8\u51fd\u6570\u63a5\u53e3 (FFI) \u548c\u901a\u7528\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f (CDF) \u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u96c6\u6210RDLs\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7279\u5f81\u4e86\u89e3\u751a\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5bf9FFI\u548cCDF\u4e24\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eCDF\u7684RDL\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u63d2\u4ef6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u91c7\u7528\u901a\u7528\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f (CDF) \u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u529f\u80fd\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u5316RDL\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00RDLs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u89c1\u89e3\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades.

Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: *one-query-per-CTA* execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while *one-size-fits-all* tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.\n  This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 67.4% on average and TPOT by 13.6-83.4% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0PAT\uff0c\u4f18\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684KV Cache\u8bbf\u95ee\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8bf7\u6c42\u95f4\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5171\u4eab\u524d\u7f00\uff08\u5982\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u3001RAG\u6a21\u677f\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u590d\u7684KV Cache\u52a0\u8f7d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7pack-forward-merge\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1) \u6309\u5171\u4eab\u524d\u7f00\u805a\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee 2) \u591atile\u5185\u6838\u63d0\u5347\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387 3) \u591a\u6d41\u8f6c\u53d1\u4e0eKV\u62c6\u5206\u964d\u4f4e\u6c14\u6ce1 4) \u5728\u7ebfsoftmax\u5408\u5e76", "result": "\u5728vLLM\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e/\u5408\u6210\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e67.4%\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0cTPOT\u6539\u8fdb13.6-83.4%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982FlashAttention\uff09", "conclusion": "PAT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u538b\u529b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u89e3\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Despite advancements in repository-level code translation, validating the translations remains challenging. This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability.

Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by generating executable code from natural language descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the trustworthiness of open-source LLMs in autonomously producing Python scripts for scientific data analysis and visualization. We construct a benchmark suite of domain-inspired prompts that reflect real-world research tasks and systematically evaluate the executability and correctness of the generated code. Our findings show that, without human intervention, the reliability of LLM-generated code is limited, with frequent failures caused by ambiguous prompts and the models' insufficient understanding of domain-specific contexts. To address these challenges, we design and assess three complementary strategies: data-aware prompt disambiguation, retrieval-augmented prompt enhancement, and iterative error repair. While these methods significantly improve execution success rates and output quality, further refinement is needed.

Using a controlled 5G Standalone testbed with commercial user equipment and a software defined radio adversarial device, we study how each manipulation affects the coherence among physical layer measurements, MAC scheduling decisions, and configuration metadata. The results show that every manipulation produces a distinct and reproducible signature that is not visible from any single telemetry source. Power offsets weaken the natural connection between SNR and CQI, timing drift breaks the alignment maintained by the scheduler, and off grant activity produces uplink energy that does not agree with allocation logs. These inconsistencies appear in merged multi layer time series traces and in cross domain views such as the SNR to CQI plane. The findings indicate that cross layer coherence provides a practical signal for detecting uplink misbehavior using only standard gNB telemetry, with no protocol modifications required, which makes the method suitable for integration into operational monitoring and auditing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision. We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the model. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in facilitating task offloading.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In practice, most DP implementations use the add/remove adjacency relation, where two datasets are adjacent if one can be obtained from the other by adding or removing a single record, thereby protecting membership. In many ML applications, however, the goal is to protect attributes of individual records (e.g., labels used in supervised fine-tuning). We show that privacy accounting under add/remove overstates attribute privacy compared to accounting under the substitute adjacency relation, which permits substituting one record. To demonstrate this gap, we develop novel attacks to audit DP under substitute adjacency, and show empirically that audit results are inconsistent with DP guarantees reported under add/remove, yet remain consistent with the budget accounted under the substitute adjacency relation.

A significant \"language barrier\" currently separates technical security teams, who focus on algorithmic vulnerabilities (e.g., MITRE ATLAS), from legal and compliance professionals, who address regulatory mandates (e.g., EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF). This disciplinary disconnect prevents the accurate translation of technical vulnerabilities into financial liability, leaving practitioners unable to answer fundamental economic questions regarding contingency reserves, control return-on-investment, and insurance exposure. To bridge this gap, this research presents the AI System Threat Vector Taxonomy, a structured ontology designed explicitly for Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA).

Uniquely, each domain maps technical vectors directly to business loss categories (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Legal, Reputation), enabling the translation of abstract threats into measurable financial impact. The taxonomy is empirically validated through an analysis of 133 documented AI incidents from 2025 (achieving 100% classification coverage) and reconciled against the main AI risk frameworks.

In many cases, the necessary information to protect digital assets exists, e.g., via contractual relationships and cadaster entries, but there is currently no uniform way of retrieving and verifying these documents.

This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6211\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u8eab\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5408\u4f5c\u4e0e\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u53bb\u8026\u5408\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff08\u5982\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f25\u5408\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5272\u88c2\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AIXI\uff09\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u6211\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u81ea\u8eab\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c06 epistemic \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9650\u9636\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u65b0\u578b\u5408\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u666e\u9002\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff08Solomonoff\u5148\u9a8c\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u81f4 mutual \u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u6211\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, state-of-the-art serving systems co-batch heterogeneous adapters without accounting for rank (size) variability, leading to severe performance skew, which ultimately requires adding more GPUs to satisfy service-level objectives (SLOs). Existing optimizations, focused on loading, caching, and kernel execution, ignore this heterogeneity, leaving GPU resources underutilized.

This study explores the relationship between security policies and dependency management in PyPI projects. We analyzed projects with and without a SECURITY.md file by examining their dependency trees and tracking how dependencies change over time. The analysis shows that projects with a security policy tend to rely on a broader set of direct dependencies, while overall depth and transitive dependencies remain similar. Historically, projects created after the introduction of SECURITY.md, particularly later adopters, show more frequent dependency updates.

Cross-domain access control involves access to resources across different organizations, institutions, or applications. Traditional access control, however, which handles authentication and authorization separately in centralized environments, faces challenges in identity dispersion, privacy leakage, and diversified permission requirements, failing to adapt to cross-domain scenarios. Thus, there is an urgent need for a new access control mechanism that empowers autonomous control over user identity and resources, addressing the demands for privacy-preserving authentication and flexible authorization in cross-domain scenarios. To address cross-domain access control challenges, we propose POLARIS, a unified and extensible architecture that enables policy-based, verifiable and privacy-preserving access control across different domains. POLARIS features a structured commitment mechanism for reliable, fine-grained, policy-based identity disclosure. It further introduces VPPL, a lightweight policy language that supports issuer-bound evaluation of selectively revealed attributes.

In this work we present NOMAD, a cognitively inspired, modular multi-agent framework that decomposes UML generation into a series of role-specialised subtasks. Each agent handles a distinct modelling activity, such as entity extraction, relationship classification, and diagram synthesis, mirroring the goal-directed reasoning processes of an engineer. This decomposition improves interpretability and allows for targeted verification strategies. We evaluate NOMAD through a mixed design: a large case study (Northwind) for in-depth probing and error analysis, and human-authored UML exercises for breadth and realism. NOMAD outperforms all selected baselines, while revealing persistent challenges in fine-grained attribute extraction. Building on these observations, we introduce the first systematic taxonomy of errors in LLM-generated UML diagrams, categorising structural, relationship, and semantic/logical. Finally, we examine verification as a design probe, showing its mixed effects and outlining adaptive strategies as promising directions. Together, these contributions position NOMAD as both an effective framework for UML class diagram generation and a lens onto the broader research challenges of reliable language-to-model workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While Qwen3Guard-8B achieved the highest overall accuracy (85.3%, 95% CI: 83.4-87.1%), a critical finding emerged when separating public benchmark prompts from novel attacks: all models showed substantial performance degradation on unseen prompts, with Qwen3Guard dropping from 91.0% to 33.8% (a 57.2 percentage point gap). In contrast, Granite-Guardian-3.2-5B showed the best generalization with only a 6.5% gap. A \"helpful mode\" jailbreak was also discovered where two guardrail models (Nemotron-Safety-8B, Granite-Guardian-3.2-5B) generated harmful content instead of blocking it, representing a novel failure mode.

A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5RecToM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684Sally-Anne\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRecToM\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u63a8\u65ad\u6f5c\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u63a8\u65ad\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRecToM\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3001\u6218\u7565\u6027\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "RecToM\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u8350\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Frameworks and standards, such as the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC), ID-Link and Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) provide a strong foundation to realize this ecosystem.

The DSL empowers domain experts to specify fine-grained data governance requirements - such as restricting access to data from specific production batches or enforcing automatic deletion after a defined retention period - without writing imperative code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a4.0\u4e2d\u8054\u90a6\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u6267\u884c\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u8bed\u8a00\uff08DSL\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u58f0\u660e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8bfb\u4e14\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7b56\u7565\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5728\u5236\u9020\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8de8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8fb9\u754c\u5171\u4eab\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u8bed\u8a00\uff08DSL\uff09\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3b\u6743\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u65e0\u9700\u7f16\u5199\u5f3a\u5236\u4ee3\u7801\u5373\u53ef\u8868\u8ff0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "result": "DSL\u5141\u8bb8\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ee5\u58f0\u660e\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5236\u5b9a\u5982\u9650\u5236\u7279\u5b9a\u751f\u4ea7\u6279\u6b21\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u5b9a\u4e49\u81ea\u52a8\u5220\u9664\u4fdd\u7559\u671f\u9650\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8de8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u3002"}}

This work introduces a multi-agent, text gradient-driven framework that performs DP composition generation under natural-language conditions by integrating three complementary feedback sources: LLM-based self-evaluation, DP-specific domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design aimed at advancing sustainable technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) has gained prominence due to its robust theoretical foundations and fine-grained analysis capabilities. However, recent studies have identified a critical challenge: noise phenomena, specifically the false kill relationships between mutants and tests, which significantly degrade localization effectiveness. While several approaches have been proposed to rectify the final localization results, they do not directly address the underlying noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to refine the kill matrix, a core data structure capturing mutant-test relationships in MBFL, by treating it as a signal that contains both meaningful fault-related patterns and high-frequency noise. Inspired by signal processing theory, we introduce DKMR (Denoising-based Kill Matrix Refinement), which employs two key stages: (1) signal enhancement through hybrid matrix construction to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for better denoising, and (2) signal denoising via frequency domain filtering to suppress noise while preserving fault-related patterns. Building on this foundation, we develop MBFL-DKMR, a fault localization framework that utilizes the refined matrix with fuzzy values for suspiciousness calculation. Our evaluation on Defects4J v2.0.0 demonstrates that MBFL-DKMR effectively mitigates the noise and outperforms the state-of-the-art MBFL techniques. Specifically, MBFL-DKMR achieves 129 faults localized at Top-1 compared to 85 for BLMu and 103 for Delta4Ms, with negligible additional computational overhead (0.11 seconds, 0.001\\% of total time). This work highlights the potential of signal processing techniques to enhance the effectiveness of MBFL by refining the kill matrix.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing research has not fully addressed the risk of attackers exploiting the spatiotemporal correlation of 3D spatiotemporal trajectories and the impact of height information, both of which can potentially lead to significant privacy leakage. To address these issues, this paper proposes a personalized 3D spatiotemporal trajectory privacy protection mechanism, named 3DSTPM. First, we analyze the characteristics of attackers that exploit spatiotemporal correlations between locations in a trajectory and present the attack model. Next, we exploit the complementary characteristics of 3D geo-indistinguishability (3D-GI) and distortion privacy to find a protection location set (PLS) that obscures the real location for all possible locations. To address the issue of privacy accumulation caused by continuous trajectory queries, we propose a Window-based Adaptive Privacy Budget Allocation (W-APBA), which dynamically allocates privacy budgets to all locations in the current PLS based on their predictability and sensitivity. Finally, we perturb the real location using the allocated privacy budget by the PF (Permute-and-Flip) mechanism, effectively balancing privacy protection and Quality of Service (QoS). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 3DSTPM effectively reduces QoS loss while meeting the user's personalized privacy protection needs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e09\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u8f68\u8ff9\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3a3DSTPM\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u5206\u6790\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5229\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\u30022. \u5229\u75283D\u5730\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fa8\u522b\u6027\uff083D-GI\uff09\u548c\u5931\u771f\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u96c6\u5408\uff08PLS\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u6df7\u6dc6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u30023. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff08W-APBA\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u30024. \u4f7f\u7528PF (Permute-and-Flip)\u673a\u5236\u6270\u52a8\u771f\u5b9e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\uff08QoS\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c3DSTPM\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11QoS\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": ""}}

Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Automated detection methods can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce costs; however, existing approaches still face several challenges, including low detection accuracy on imbalanced data, limited semantic extraction due to the use of a single encoder, and suboptimal performance in cross-domain transfer learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Transferable Software Requirement Conflict Detection Framework based on SBERT and SimCSE, termed TSRCDF-SS. First, the framework employs two independent encoders, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and Simple Contrastive Sentence Embedding (SimCSE), to generate sentence embeddings for requirement pairs, followed by a six-element concatenation strategy. Furthermore, the classifier is enhanced by a two-layer fully connected feedforward neural network (FFNN) with a hybrid loss optimization strategy that integrates a variant of Focal Loss, domain-specific constraints, and a confidence-based penalty term. Finally, the framework synergistically integrates sequential and cross-domain transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 10.4% improvement in both macro-F1 and weighted-F1 scores in in-domain settings, and an 11.4% increase in macro-F1 in cross-domain scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this problem, organizations rely on security awareness programs, which aim to make employees more resilient against social engineering. While some works have suggested that such programs should account for contextual relevance, the common praxis in research is to adopt a \"general\" viewpoint. For instance, instead of focusing on department-specific issues, prior user studies sought to provide organization-wide conclusions. Such a protocol may lead to overlooking vulnerabilities that affect only specific subsets of an organization.\n  In this paper, we tackle such an oversight. First, through a systematic literature review, we provide evidence that prior literature poorly accounted for department-specific needs. Then, we carry out a multi-company and mixed-methods study focusing on two pivotal departments: human resources (HR) and accounting. We explore three dimensions: threats faced by these departments; topics covered in the security-awareness campaigns delivered to these departments; and delivery methods that maximize the effectiveness of such campaigns. We begin by interviewing 16 employees of a multinational enterprise, and then use these results as a scaffold to design a structured survey through which we collect the responses of over 90 HR/accounting members of 9 organizations. We find that HR is targeted through job applications containing malware and executive impersonation, while accounting is exposed to invoice fraud, credential theft, and ransomware. Current training is often viewed as too generic, with employees preferring shorter, scenario-based formats like videos and simulations. These preferences contradict the common industry practice of annual sessions. Based on these insights, we propose recommendations for designing awareness programs tailored to departmental needs and workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, unlike less conservative belief revision methods, minimal revision falls short in learning power: It cannot learn everything that can be learned by other learning methods. We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade. Finally, we show that not all of our results still hold when learning from possibly erroneous information.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Rollups improve transaction throughput by processing operations off-chain and posting the results on-chain. A critical component in Rollups is the Sequencer, responsible for receiving, ordering and batching transactions before they are submitted to the Layer-1 blockchain. While essential, the centralized nature of the Sequencer makes it vulnerable to attacks, such as censorship, transaction manipulation and tampering. To enhance its security, there are solutions in the literature that shield the Sequencer inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). However, the attestation of TEEs introduces additional centralization, which is in contrast with the core Blockchain principle. In this paper, we propose a TEE-secured Sequencer equipped with a decentralized attestation mechanism. We outline the design and implementation of our solution, covering the system architecture, TEE integration, and the decentralization of the attestation process. Additionally, we present an experimental evaluation conducted on a realistic Rollup testnet.

However, MBFL faces significant challenges due to interference mutants generated from non-faulty code entities but can be killed by failing tests. These mutants mimic the test sensitivity behaviors of real faulty code entities and weaken the effectiveness of fault localization. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Fault Localization Interference Mutants (FLIMs) and conduct a theoretical analysis based on the Reachability, Infection, Propagation, and Revealability (RIPR) model, identifying four distinct interference causes. Building on this, we propose a novel approach to semantically recognize and mitigate FLIMs using LLM-based semantic analysis, enhanced by fine-tuning techniques and confidence estimation strategies to address LLM output instability. The recognized FLIMs are then mitigated by refining the suspiciousness scores calculated from MBFL techniques. We integrate FLIM recognition and mitigation into the MBFL workflow, developing MBFL-FLIM, a fault localization framework that enhances MBFL's effectiveness by reducing misleading interference while preserving real fault-revealing information. Our empirical experiments on the Defects4J benchmark with 395 program versions using eight LLMs demonstrate MBFL-FLIM's superiority over traditional SBFL and MBFL methods, advanced dynamic feature-based approaches, and recent LLM-based fault localization techniques. Specifically, MBFL-FLIM achieves an average improvement of 44 faults in the Top-1 metric, representing a significant enhancement over baseline methods.

By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5982\u4f55\u786e\u4fdd\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86DeepSeekMath-V2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6210\u7ee9\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9AI\u662f\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u63a8\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u8be6\u7ec6\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u5168\u9762\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684LLM\u57fa\u7840\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\u5229\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc1\u660e\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u6fc0\u52b1\u5176\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u81ea\u8eab\u8bc1\u660e\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u52a0\u5f3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b0\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7684DeepSeekMath-V2\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728IMO 2025\u548cCMO 2024\u8fbe\u5230\u91d1\u724c\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Putnam 2024\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684118/120\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5927\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u83b7\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u5c31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u5c55\uff0cDeepSeekMath-V2\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) improve chart representation, existing approaches still struggle to achieve cross-type generalization, memory efficiency, and modular design. To address these challenges, this paper proposes C2C-MoLA, a multimodal framework that synergizes Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The MoE component uses a complexity-aware routing mechanism with domain-specialized experts and load-balanced sparse gating, dynamically allocating inputs based on learnable structural metrics like element count and chart complexity. LoRA enables parameter-efficient updates for resource-conscious tuning, further supported by a tailored training strategy that aligns routing stability with semantic accuracy. Experiments on Chart2Code-160k show that the proposed model improves generation accuracy by up to 17%, reduces peak GPU memory by 18%, and accelerates convergence by 20%, when compared to standard fine-tuning and LoRA-only baselines, particularly on complex charts.

To date, several approaches have been proposed based on the Residue Number System variant of the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (RNS-CKKS) scheme. However, they all suffer from high latency, which severely limits the applications in real-world tasks. Currently, the research on encrypted inference in deep CNNs confronts three main bottlenecks: i) the time and storage costs of convolution calculation; ii) the time overhead of huge bootstrapping operations; and iii) the consumption of circuit multiplication depth. Towards these three challenges, we in this paper propose an efficient and effective mechanism FastFHE to accelerate the model inference while simultaneously retaining high inference accuracy over fully homomorphic encryption. Concretely, our work elaborates four unique novelties. First, we propose a new scalable ciphertext data-packing scheme to save the time and storage consumptions. Second, we work out a depthwise-separable convolution fashion to degrade the computation load of convolution calculation. Third, we figure out a BN dot-product fusion matrix to merge the ciphertext convolutional layer with the batch-normalization layer without incurring extra multiplicative depth.

AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks.

With the emergence of innovative defensive solutions that place system- and algorithm-level checks and corrections in the input and weight spaces, these perturbations are increasingly susceptible to defenses. This work develops a novel perspective on Trojan attacks that generates an attacker-designed model output while leaving no attack traces on the inputs or weights. Such an attack space can be unlocked through corruption of the key-value (KV) cache. In this paper, we introduce CacheTrap, a novel Trojan attack that corrupts the value vectors stored in the KV cache. These vectors capture the dynamic activations for specific token positions and therefore constitute a natural surface for transient, inference-time trigger insertion. The transient nature of these KV values and their dependence on victim input imply additional constraints on our attack, such as a lack of knowledge of the victim's data or domain application, and, consequently, a lack of gradient information. The objective of the proposed CacheTrap is to develop a vulnerable KV bit-searching algorithm so that, once the attack employs the identified bit-flip as a trigger, the model generates targeted behavior, e.g., classifying inputs towards the target class.

Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed attack enables the first successful Trojan attack on LLMs with a single bit flip in the KV cache.

This growing adoption underscores the need to ensure their security and robustness. In this work, we focus on the impact of Bit Flip Attacks (BFAs) on LLMs, which exploits hardware faults to corrupt model parameters, posing a significant threat to model integrity and performance. Existing studies on BFA against LLMs adopt a progressive bit-search strategy that predominantly relies on gradient-based techniques to identify sensitive layers or weights. However, computing gradients comes with two specific challenges: First, in the context of LLMs, it increases computational and memory costs exponentially, and Second, it requires access to a sample victim dataset or knowledge of the victim domain to compute the gradient. In this work, we investigate beyond the scope of attack efficacy and aim to develop an efficient, practical Gradient-Data-free Bit-Flip Attack. The challenge lies in the core principle of adversarial attacks, which relies heavily on computing gradients from sample test/train data and manipulating model weights based on gradient information. To overcome this, we propose novel vulnerability index metrics that can identify vulnerable weight bits in LLMs independent of any gradient or data knowledge. By removing the dependency on gradient computation, our approach drastically reduces memory requirements and scales efficiently across multiple tasks with constant complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our method, requiring as few as a single bit flip to achieve adversarial objectives for five open-source LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Fundamentally, a hybrid reasoning engine will synchronize four special-purpose agents, which include: a personalized-nutrition-based, called a Meal Planner Agent; an adaptive-scheduling-based, called a Reminder Agent; interactive assistance during grocery shopping and cooking, called a Food Guidance Agent; and a continuous-intake-and-physiological-tracking, called a Monitoring Agent.

While the potential benefits of swarm-based UAV networks are growing significantly, they are vulnerable to various security attacks that can jeopardize the overall mission success by degrading their performance, disrupting decision-making, and compromising the trajectory planning process. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a vital role in identifying potential security attacks to ensure the secure operation of UAV swarm networks. However, conventional IDS primarily focuses on binary classification with resource-intensive neural networks and faces challenges, including latency, privacy breaches, increased performance overhead, and model drift. This research aims to address these challenges by developing a novel lightweight and federated continuous learning-based IDS scheme. Our proposed model facilitates decentralized training across diverse UAV swarms to ensure data heterogeneity and privacy. The performance evaluation of our model demonstrates significant improvements, with classification accuracies of 99.45% on UKM-IDS, 99.99% on UAV-IDS, 96.85% on TLM-UAV dataset, and 98.05% on Cyber-Physical datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For this reason, security-oriented disciplines of signal processing have received increasing attention in the last decades: multimedia forensics, digital watermarking, biometrics, network monitoring, steganography and steganalysis are just a few examples. Even though each of these fields has its own peculiarities, they all have to deal with a common problem: the presence of one or more adversaries aiming at making the system fail. Adversarial Signal Processing lays the basis of a general theory that takes into account the impact that the presence of an adversary has on the design of effective signal processing tools. By focusing on the application side of Adversarial Signal Processing, namely adversarial information fusion in distributed sensor networks, and adopting a game-theoretic approach, this thesis contributes to the above mission by addressing four issues. First, we address decision fusion in distributed sensor networks by developing a novel soft isolation defense scheme that protect the network from adversaries, specifically, Byzantines. Second, we develop an optimum decision fusion strategy in the presence of Byzantines. In the next step, we propose a technique to reduce the complexity of the optimum fusion by relying on a novel near-optimum message passing algorithm based on factor graphs.

Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy.

Hyb-Agg reduces the secure aggregation process to a single, non-interactive client-to-server transmission per round, ensuring that per-client communication remains constant regardless of the number of participants. This design eliminates partial decryption exchanges, preserves strong privacy under the RLWE, CDH, and random oracle assumptions, and maintains robustness against collusion by the server and up to $N-2$ clients.\n  We implement and evaluate Hyb-Agg on both high-performance and resource-constrained devices, including a Raspberry Pi 4, demonstrating that it delivers sub-second execution times while achieving a constant communication expansion factor of approximately 12x over plaintext size.

Existing exact unlearning methods typically require frequent retraining from scratch, resulting in high communication cost and long service downtime. To address this, we propose Federated Sequential Group-based Training (FedSGT), an exact unlearning framework for FL. FedSGT partitions the data into uniform groups, and each client may participate in multiple groups. To control communication overhead, each client can limit the number of groups it contributes to. FedSGT then trains multiple sequences of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) modules, each corresponding to a different group permutation. Since the PEFT modules are lightweight and maintained server-side, FedSGT isolates the influence of different data groups into independent modules without incurring significant storage overhead and communication cost. Exact unlearning is thus achieved instantly by deactivating the modules corresponding to the group containing the unlearned data. Furthermore, using multiple training sequences helps maintain high model utility as deletion requests accumulate. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of both the deletion rate -- expected number of deletions before retraining is needed -- and the expected model performance. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate that FedSGT achieves a significantly longer service maintenance under multiple unlearning requests while maintaining comparable learning performance and training efficiency to other exact unlearning baselines.

In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff08MCTR\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u65b0\u9896\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0d\u65ad\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "method": "MCTR\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a1\uff09\u5143\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u6d4b\u8bd5\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u5f52\u7eb3\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u89c4\u5219\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b2\uff09\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u5229\u7528\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b3\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u65ad\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u572845\u4e2aAtari\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cMCTR\u572833\u4e2a\u5df2\u77e5\u548c12\u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0cMCTR\u57289\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e24\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5143\u63a8\u7406\u5411\u4eba\u7c7b\u6837\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "MCTR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4e0d\u65ad\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Unlike standard approaches that treat forecasts as flat time series, our framework performs multi-scale reasoning across hourly, 6-hour, and daily aggregations to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term trends. Its core reasoning agent converts structured meteorological inputs into coherent narratives while simultaneously extracting a few keywords effectively summarizing the dominant meteorological events. These keywords serve as semantic anchors for validating consistency, temporal coherence and factual alignment of the generated reports. Using OpenWeather and Meteostat data, we demonstrate that hierarchical context and keyword-based validation substantially improve interpretability and robustness of LLM-generated weather narratives, offering a reproducible framework for semantic evaluation of automated meteorological reporting and advancing agent-based scientific reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHierarchical AI-Meteorologist\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u9884\u62a5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5929\u6c14\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5c0f\u65f6\u30016\u5c0f\u65f6\u548c\u5929\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u77ed\u671f\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6c14\u8c61\u8f93\u5165\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8fde\u8d2f\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u6c14\u8c61\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u5c42\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u5929\u6c14\u53d9\u8ff0\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u77ed\u671f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u9884\u62a5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u9884\u62a5\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u65f6\u30016\u5c0f\u65f6\u548c\u5929\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u5929\u6c14\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u6c14\u8c61\u8bcd\u6c47\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5229\u7528OpenWeather\u548cMeteostat\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u5929\u6c14\u53d9\u8ff0\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u6c14\u8c61\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63a8\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": " Hierarchical AI-Meteorologist\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c14\u8c61\u62a5\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SuperIntelliAgent\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\uff09\u548c\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u667a\u529b\u6210\u957f\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4e92\u52a8\u548c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u91cd\u64ad\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u578b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7Direct Preference Optimization\uff08DPO\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "SuperIntelliAgent\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u6211\u5347\u7ea7\u5e76\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u914d\u5bf9\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u5386\u53f2\u56de\u653e\u53ef\u5f62\u6210\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8bfe\u7a0b\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u667a\u80fd\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}
