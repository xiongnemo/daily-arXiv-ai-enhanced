Abstract: Convex Agreement (CA) strengthens Byzantine Agreement (BA) by requiring the output agreed upon to lie in the convex hull of the honest parties' inputs. This validity condition is motivated by practical aggregation tasks (e.g., robust learning or sensor fusion) where honest inputs need not coincide but should still constrain the decision. CA inherits BA lower bounds, and optimal synchronous round complexity is easy to obtain (e.g., via Byzantine Broadcast). The main challenge is \emph{communication}: standard approaches for CA have a communication complexity of $Θ(Ln^2)$ for large $L$-bit inputs, leaving a gap in contrast to BA's lower bound of $Ω(Ln)$ bits. While recent work achieves optimal communication complexity of $O(Ln)$ for sufficiently large $L$ [GLW,PODC'25], translating this result to general convexity spaces remained an open problem.
  We investigate this gap for abstract convexity spaces, and we present deterministic synchronous CA protocols with near-optimal communication complexity: when $L = Ω(n \cdot κ)$, where $κ$ is a security parameter, we achieve $O(L\cdot n\log n)$ communication for finite convexity spaces and $O(L\cdot n^{1+o(1)})$ communication for Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our protocols have asymptotically optimal round complexity $O(n)$ and, when a bound on the inputs' lengths $L$ is fixed a priori, we achieve near-optimal resilience $t < n/(ω+\varepsilon)$ for any constant $\varepsilon>0$, where $ω$ is the Helly number of the convexity space. If $L$ is unknown, we still achieve resilience $t<n/(ω+\varepsilon+1)$ for any constant $\varepsilon > 0$. We further note that our protocols can be leveraged to efficiently solve parallel BA.
  Our main technical contribution is the use of extractor graphs to obtain a deterministic assignment of parties to committees, which is resilient against adaptive adversaries.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The performance of multi-turn, agentic LLM inference is increasingly dominated by KV-Cache storage I/O rather than computation. In prevalent disaggregated architectures, loading the massive KV-Cache from external storage creates a fundamental imbalance: storage NICs on prefill engines become bandwidth-saturated, while those on decoding engines remain idle. This asymmetry severely constrains overall system throughput.
  We present DualPath, an inference system that breaks this bottleneck by introducing dual-path KV-Cache loading. Beyond the traditional storage-to-prefill path, DualPath enables a novel storage-to-decode path, in which the KV-Cache is loaded into decoding engines and then efficiently transferred to prefill engines via RDMA over the compute network. DualPath combines this optimized data path -- which inherently avoids network congestion and avoids interference with latency-critical model execution communications -- with a global scheduler that dynamically balances load across prefill and decode engines.
  Our evaluation on three models with production agentic workloads demonstrates that DualPath improves offline inference throughput by up to 1.87$\times$ on our in-house inference system. It can also improve online serving throughput by an average factor of 1.96$\times$ without violating SLO.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, but serving them efficiently at scale remains a critical challenge due to their substantial computational and latency demands. While most existing inference frameworks rely on simple scheduling strategies such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) at the engine level and Round-Robin (RR) at the scheduler or coordinator level, they often fail to fully utilize system resources and may suffer from issues such as head-of-line blocking and load imbalance. Recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have also introduced new challenges in scheduling arising from expert parallelism and routing complexity. This research proposes a multi-layer scheduling framework tailored for MoE-based LLM serving. It targets scheduling at three levels: request-level, enginelevel, and expert-level. At the request level, we explore algorithms such as Shortest-Job-First (SJF) and priority-aware aging to improve throughput and reduce latency. At the engine level, we design load-aware dispatching strategies that account for the current prefix token load, KV cache utilization, and user stickiness to achieve better resource matching. At the expert level, we focus on alleviating expert hotspots and strategically placing inter-layer expert dependencies to balance load and improve routing efficiency. Extensive experimental results from more than 100 experiments conducted under diverse workload distributions show that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-theart inference framework vLLM, achieving up to 17.8% reduction in Time To First Token (TTFT) latency and 13.3% reduction in Time-Per-Output-Token (TPOT) latency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Lamport's 1978 paper introduced the happens-before relation and logical clocks, freeing distributed systems from dependence on synchronized physical clocks. This is widely understood as a move away from Newtonian absolute time. We argue that Lamport's formalism retains a deeper and largely unexamined assumption: that causality induces a globally well-defined directed acyclic graph (DAG) over events -- a forward-in-time-only (FITO) structure that functions as an arrow of time embedded at the semantic level. Following Ryle's analysis of category mistakes, we show that this assumption conflates an epistemic construct (the logical ordering of messages) with an ontic claim (that physical causality is globally acyclic and monotonic). We trace this conflation through Shannon's channel model, TLA+, Bell's theorem, and the impossibility results of Fischer-Lynch-Paterson and Brewer's CAP theorem. We then show that special and general relativity permit only local causal structure, and that recent work on indefinite causal order demonstrates that nature admits correlations with no well-defined causal ordering. We propose that mutual information conservation, rather than temporal precedence, provides a more fundamental primitive for distributed consistency.

Abstract: Scaling long-context capabilities is crucial for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, real-world multimodal datasets are extremely heterogeneous. Existing training frameworks predominantly rely on static parallelism strategies, which suffer from severe load imbalance, redundant communication, and suboptimal hardware utilization under data heterogeneity. In this work, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Parallelism (DHP), an efficient parallelism strategy that adaptively reconfigures communication groups and parallelism degrees during MLLM training. We generalize the non-power-of-two parallelism degrees and develop a polynomial-time algorithm to generate near-optimal parallelism strategies with only millisecond-level overhead per training batch. DHP is able to maintain high hardware efficiency even under extreme data variability. Experimental results demonstrate that DHP significantly outperforms Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed, achieving up to 1.36 $\times$ speedup in training throughput while maintaining near-linear scaling efficiency across large-scale NPU clusters.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Heterogeneous nodes that combine multi-core CPUs with diverse accelerators are rapidly becoming the norm in both high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructures. Exploiting these platforms, however, requires orchestrating several low-level accelerator APIs such as CUDA, SYCL, and Triton. In some occasions they can be combined with optimized vendor math libraries: e.g., cuBLAS and oneAPI. Each API or library introduces its own abstractions, execution semantics, and synchronization mechanisms. Combining them within a single application is therefore error-prone and labor-intensive. We propose reusing a task-based data-flow methodology together with Task-Aware APIs (TA-libs) to overcome these limitations and facilitate the seamless integration of multiple accelerator programming models, while still leveraging the best-in-class kernels offered by each API.
  Applications are expressed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of host tasks and device kernels managed by an OpenMP/OmpSs-2 runtime. We introduce Task-Aware SYCL (TASYCL) and leverage Task-Aware CUDA (TACUDA), which elevate individual accelerator invocations to first-class tasks. When multiple native runtimes coexist on the same multi-core CPU, they contend for threads, leading to oversubscription and performance variability. To address this, we unify their thread management under the nOS-V tasking and threading library, to which we contribute a new port of the PoCL (Portable OpenCL) runtime.
  These results demonstrate that task-aware libraries, coupled with the nOS-V library, enable a single application to harness multiple accelerator programming models transparently and efficiently. The proposed methodology is immediately applicable to current heterogeneous nodes and is readily extensible to future systems that integrate even richer combinations of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and AI accelerators.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a problem of minimizing total energy consumption for secure federated learning (FL) over wireless edge networks. To address the high computational cost and privacy challenges in conventional FL with neural networks (NN) for resource-constrained users, we propose a novel FL with hyperdimensional computing and differential privacy (FL-HDC-DP) framework. In the considered model, each edge user employs hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for local training, which replaces complex neural updates with simple hypervector operations, and applies differential privacy (DP) noise to protect transmitted model information. We optimize the total energy of computation and communication under both latency and privacy constraints. We formulate the problem as an optimization that minimizes the total energy of all users by jointly allocating HDC dimension, transmission time, system bandwidth, transmit power, and CPU frequency. To solve this problem, a sigmoid-variant function is proposed to characterize the relationship between the HDC dimension and the convergence rounds required to reach a target accuracy. Based on this model, we develop two alternating optimization algorithms, where closed-form expressions for time, frequency, bandwidth, and power allocations are derived at each iteration. Since the iterative algorithm requires a feasible initialization, we construct a feasibility problem and obtain feasible initial resource parameters by solving a per round transmission time minimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FL-HDC-DP framework achieves up to 83.3% total energy reduction compared with the baseline, while attaining about 90% accuracy in approximately 3.5X fewer communication rounds than the NN baseline.

Abstract: As the complexity of the HPC storage stack rapidly grows, domain scientists face increasing challenges in effectively utilizing HPC storage systems to achieve their desired I/O performance. To identify and address I/O issues, scientists largely rely on I/O experts to analyze their I/O traces and provide insights into potential problems. However, with a limited number of I/O experts and the growing demand for data-intensive applications, inaccessibility has become a major bottleneck, hindering scientists from maximizing their productivity. Rapid advances in LLMs make it possible to build an automated tool that brings trustworthy I/O performance diagnosis to domain scientists. However, key challenges remain, such as the inability to handle long context windows, a lack of accurate domain knowledge about HPC I/O, and the generation of hallucinations during complex interactions.In this work, we propose IOAgent as a systematic effort to address these challenges. IOAgent integrates a module-based pre-processor, a RAG-based domain knowledge integrator, and a tree-based merger to accurately diagnose I/O issues from a given Darshan trace file. Similar to an I/O expert, IOAgent provides detailed justifications and references for its diagnoses and offers an interactive interface for scientists to ask targeted follow-up questions. To evaluate IOAgent, we collected a diverse set of labeled job traces and released the first open diagnosis test suite, TraceBench. Using this test suite, we conducted extensive evaluations, demonstrating that IOAgent matches or outperforms state-of-the-art I/O diagnosis tools with accurate and useful diagnosis results. We also show that IOAgent is not tied to specific LLMs, performing similarly well with both proprietary and open-source LLMs. We believe IOAgent has the potential to become a powerful tool for scientists navigating complex HPC I/O subsystems in the future.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and diversity of hardware accelerators in modern computing systems demand flexible, low-overhead program analysis tools. We present PASTA, a low-overhead and modular Program AnalysiS Tool Framework for Accelerators. PASTA abstracts over low-level profiling APIs and diverse deep learning frameworks, offering users a unified interface to capture and analyze runtime events at multiple levels. Its extensible design enables researchers and practitioners to rapidly prototype custom tools with minimal overhead. We demonstrate the utility of PASTA by developing several analysis tools, including a deep learning workload characterization tool and a UVM optimization tool. Through extensive evaluation on mainstream deep learning workloads tested on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs under both single- and multi-GPU scenarios, we demonstrate PASTA's broad applicability. On NVIDIA GPUs, we further show that PASTA provides detailed performance insights with significantly lower overhead, up to 1.3*10^4 faster than conventional analysis tools, thanks to its GPU-accelerated backend. PASTA strikes a practical balance between usability, extensibility, and efficiency, making it well-suited for modern accelerator-based computing environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Checkpointing is essential for fault tolerance in training large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods, regardless of their I/O strategies, periodically store the entire model and optimizer states, incurring substantial storage overhead and resource contention. Recent studies reveal that updates across LLM layers are highly non-uniform. Across training steps, some layers may undergo more significant changes, while others remain relatively stable or even unchanged. This suggests that selectively checkpointing only layers with significant updates could reduce overhead without harming training. Implementing such selective strategies requires fine-grained control over both weights and optimizer states, which no current tool provides. To address this gap, we propose \texttt{LLMTailor}, a checkpoint-merging framework that filters and assembles layers from different checkpoints to form a composite checkpoint. Our evaluation indicates that LLMTailor can work with different selective checkpointing strategies and effectively reduce checkpoint size (e.g., 4.3 times smaller for Llama3.1-8B) and checkpoint time (e.g., 2.8 times faster for Qwen2.5-7B) while maintaining model quality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Security monitoring systems typically treat anomaly detection as identifying statistical deviations from observed data distributions. In cryptographic traffic analysis, however, violations are defined not by rarity but by explicit policy constraints, including key reuse prohibition, downgrade prevention, and bounded key lifetimes. This fundamental mismatch limits the interpretability and adaptability of conventional anomaly detection methods. We introduce INTACT (INTent-Aware Cryptographic Traffic), a policy-conditioned framework that reformulates violation detection as conditional constraint learning. Instead of learning a static decision boundary over behavioral features, INTACT models the probability of violation conditioned on both observed behavior and declared security intent. The architecture factorizes representation learning into behavioral and intent encoders whose fused embeddings produce a violation score, yielding a policy-parameterized family of decision boundaries. We evaluate the framework on a real-world network flow dataset and a 210,000-trace synthetic multi-intent cryptographic dataset. INTACT matches or exceeds strong unsupervised and supervised baselines, achieving near-perfect discrimination (AUROC up to 1.0000) in the real dataset and consistent superiority in detecting relational and composite violations in the synthetic setting. These results demonstrate that explicit intent conditioning improves discrimination, interpretability, and robustness in cryptographic monitoring.

Abstract: Cybersecurity threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making traditional defense mechanisms and manual red teaming approaches insufficient for modern organizations. While red teaming has long been recognized as an effective method to identify vulnerabilities by simulating real-world attacks, its manual execution is resource-intensive, time-consuming, and lacks scalability for frequent assessments. These limitations have driven the evolution toward auto-mated red teaming, which leverages artificial intelligence and automation to deliver efficient and adaptive security evaluations. This systematic review consolidates existing research on automated red teaming, examining its methodologies, tools, benefits, and limitations. The paper also highlights current trends, challenges, and research gaps, offering insights into future directions for improving automated red teaming as a critical component of proactive cybersecurity strategies. By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how automation enhances red teaming and strengthens organizational resilience against evolving cyber threats.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Logic locking as a solution for semiconductor intellectual property (IP) confidentiality has received considerable attention in academia, but has yet to produce a viable solution to protect against known threats. In part due to a lack of rigor, logic locking defenses have been historically short-lived, which is an unacceptable risk for hardware-based security solutions for critical systems that may be fielded for decades. Researchers have worked to map the concept of cryptographic indistinguishability to logic locking, as indistinguishability provides strong security guarantees. In an effort to bridge theory and practice, we highlight recent efforts that can be used to analyze the indistinguishability of logic locking techniques, and propose a new method of evaluation based on comparing distributions of $k$-cuts, which is akin to comparing against a library of sub-functions. We evaluate our approach on several different classes of logic locking and show up to 92% average accuracy in correctly identifying which design was locked, even in the presence of resynthesis, suggesting that the evaluated locks do not provide indistinguishability.

Abstract: Traditional phishing website detection relies on static heuristics or reference lists, which lag behind rapidly evolving attacks. While recent systems incorporate large language models (LLMs), they are still prompt-based, deterministic pipelines that underutilize reasoning capability. We present MemoPhishAgent (MPA), a memory-augmented multi-modal LLM agent that dynamically orchestrates phishing-specific tools and leverages episodic memories of past reasoning trajectories to guide decisions on recurring and novel threats. On two public datasets, MPA outperforms three state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, improving recall by 13.6%. To better reflect realistic, user-facing phishing detection performance, we further evaluate MPA on a benchmark of real-world suspicious URLs actively crawled from five social media platforms, where it improves recall by 20%. Detailed analysis shows episodic memory contributes up to 27% recall gain without introducing additional computational overhead. The ablation study confirms the necessity of the agent-based approach compared to prompt-based baselines and validates the effectiveness of our tool design. Finally, MPA is deployed in production, processing 60K targeted high-risk URLs weekly, and achieving 91.44% recall, providing proactive protection for millions of customers. Together, our results show that combining multi-modal reasoning with episodic memory yields robust phishing detection in realistic user-exposure settings.

Abstract: Current stateless defences for multimodal agentic RAG fail to detect adversarial strategies that distribute malicious semantics across retrieval, planning, and generation components. We formulate this security challenge as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where adversarial intent is a latent variable inferred from noisy multi-stage observations. We introduce MMA-RAG^T, an inference-time control framework governed by a Modular Trust Agent (MTA) that maintains an approximate belief state via structured LLM reasoning. Operating as a model-agnostic overlay, MMA-RAGT mediates a configurable set of internal checkpoints to enforce stateful defence-in-depth. Extensive evaluation on 43,774 instances demonstrates a 6.50x average reduction factor in Attack Success Rate relative to undefended baselines, with negligible utility cost. Crucially, a factorial ablation validates our theoretical bounds: while statefulness and spatial coverage are individually necessary (26.4 pp and 13.6 pp gains respectively), stateless multi-point intervention can yield zero marginal benefit under homogeneous stateless filtering when checkpoint detections are perfectly correlated.

Abstract: This paper presents the first systematic study of denial-of-service vulnerabilities in Regular Expressions with Backreferences (REwB). We introduce the Two-Phase Memory Automaton (2PMFA), an automaton model that precisely captures REwB semantics. Using this model, we derive necessary conditions under which backreferences induce super-linear backtracking runtime, even when sink ambiguity is linear -- a regime where existing detectors report no vulnerability. Based on these conditions, we identify three vulnerability patterns, develop detection and attack-construction algorithms, and validate them in practice. Using the Snort intrusion detection ruleset, our evaluation identifies 45 previously unknown REwB vulnerabilities with quadratic or worse runtime. We further demonstrate practical exploits against Snort, including slowing rule evaluation by 0.6-1.2 seconds and bypassing alerts by triggering PCRE's matching limit.

Abstract: The advent of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) presents a fundamental and existential threat to the forensic integrity and operational safety of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Technology (OT) in critical infrastructure. This paper introduces a novel, forensics-first framework for achieving quantum resilience in high-consequence environments, with a specific focus on nuclear power plants. We systematically analyze the quantum threat landscape across the Purdue architecture (L0-L5), detailing how Harvest-Now, Decrypt-Later (HNDL) campaigns, enabled by algorithms like Shor's, can retroactively compromise cryptographic foundations, undermine evidence admissibility, and facilitate sophisticated sabotage. Through two detailed case studies, \textsc{Quantum~Scar} and \textsc{Quantum~Dawn}, we demonstrate multi-phase attack methodologies where state-level adversaries exploit cryptographic monoculture and extended OT lifecycles to degrade safety systems while creating unsolvable forensic paradoxes. Our probabilistic risk modeling reveals alarming success probabilities (up to 78\% for targeted facilities under current defenses), underscoring the criticality of immediate action. In response, we propose and validate a phased, defense-in-depth migration path to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), integrating hybrid key exchange, cryptographic diversity, secure time synchronization, and side-channel resistant implementations aligned with ISA/IEC 62443 and NIST standards. The paper concludes that without urgent adoption of quantum-resilient controls, the integrity of both physical safety systems and digital forensic evidence remains at severe and irreversible risk.

Abstract: Rug-pull attacks pose a systemic threat across the blockchain ecosystem, yet research into early detection is hindered by the lack of scientific-grade datasets. Existing resources often suffer from temporal data leakage, narrow modality, and ambiguous labeling, particularly outside DeFi contexts. To address these limitations, we present TM-RugPull, a rigorously curated, leakage-resistant dataset of 1,028 token projects spanning DeFi, meme coins, NFTs, and celebrity-themed tokens. RugPull enforces strict temporal hygiene by extracting all features on chain behavior, smart contract metadata, and OSINT signals strictly from the first half of each project's lifespan. Labels are grounded in forensic reports and longevity criteria, verified through multi-expert consensus. This dataset enables causally valid, multimodal analysis of rug-pull dynamics and establishes a new benchmark for reproducible fraud detection research.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning allows multiple organizations to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data, but client updates can still leak sensitive information through inference attacks. Secure aggregation protects privacy by hiding individual updates, yet it complicates contribution evaluation, which is critical for fair rewards and detecting low-quality or malicious participants. Existing marginal-contribution methods, such as the Shapley value, are incompatible with secure aggregation, and practical alternatives, such as Leave-One-Out, are crude and rely on self-evaluation.
  We introduce two marginal-difference contribution scores compatible with secure aggregation. Fair-Private satisfies standard fairness axioms, while Everybody-Else eliminates self-evaluation and provides resistance to manipulation, addressing a largely overlooked vulnerability. We provide theoretical guarantees for fairness, privacy, robustness, and computational efficiency, and evaluate our methods on multiple medical image datasets and CIFAR10 in cross-silo settings. Our scores consistently outperform existing baselines, better approximate Shapley-induced client rankings, and improve downstream model performance as well as misbehavior detection. These results demonstrate that fairness, privacy, robustness, and practical utility can be achieved jointly in federated contribution evaluation, offering a principled solution for real-world cross-silo deployments.

Abstract: This paper concerns the Minimal Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol, which has received little attention to date, despite its potential to make the best-known IKE protocol sufficiently lightweight to be also applied in contexts where it is currently prohibitive, due to its large footprint. First, we introduce and describe Colibri, an efficient, open-source implementation of the Minimal IKE protocol, which allows us to quantitatively assess its real advantages in terms of lightness. Then we introduce a post-quantum variant of the Minimal IKE protocol, which is essential to make it contemporary, and assess it through Colibri. We demonstrate that the protocol performance remains excellent even in such a more challenging context, making it suitable for deploying pervasive and quantum-resistant virtual private networks.

Abstract: As mobile networks transition to 5G infrastructure, ensuring robust security becomes more important due to the complex architecture and expanded attack surface. Traditional security testing approaches for 5G networks rely on black-box fuzzing techniques, which are limited by their inability to observe internal program state and coverage information. This paper presents MulCovFuzz, a novel coverage-guided greybox fuzzing tool for 5G network testing. Unlike existing tools that depend solely on system response, MulCovFuzz implements a multi-component coverage collection mechanism that dynamically monitors code coverage across different components of the 5G system architecture. Our approach introduces a novel testing paradigm that includes a scoring function combining coverage rewards with efficiency metrics to guide test case generation. We evaluate MulCovFuzz on open-source 5G implementation OpenAirInterface. Our experimental results demonstrate that MulCovFuzz significantly outperforms traditional fuzzing approaches, achieving a 5.85\% increase in branch coverage, 7.17\% increase in line coverage, and 16\% improvement in unique crash discovery during 24h fuzzing testing. MulCovFuzz uncovered three zero-day vulnerabilities, two of which were not identified by any other fuzzing technique. This work contributes to the advancement of security testing tools for next-generation mobile networks.

Abstract: A large number of URLs are made public by various platforms for security analysis, archiving, and paste sharing -- such as VirusTotal, URLScan.io, Hybrid Analysis, the Wayback Machine, and RedHunt. These services may unintentionally expose links containing sensitive information, as reported in some news articles and blog posts. However, no large-scale measurement has quantified the extent of such exposures. We present an automated system that detects and analyzes potential sensitive information leaked through publicly accessible URLs. The system combines lexical URL filtering, dynamic rendering, OCR-based extraction, and content classification to identify potential leaks. We apply it to 6,094,475 URLs collected from public scanning platforms, paste sites, and web archives, identifying 12,331 potential exposures across authentication, financial, personal, and document-related domains. These findings show that sensitive information remains exposed, underscoring the importance of automated detection to identify accidental leaks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for building Trustworthy AI systems by enabling privacy-preserving, decentralized model training. However, FL is highly susceptible to adversarial attacks that compromise model integrity and data confidentiality, a vulnerability exacerbated by the fact that conventional data inspection methods are incompatible with its decentralized design. While integrating FL with Blockchain technology has been proposed to address some limitations, its potential for mitigating adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces Resilient Federated Chain (RFC), a novel blockchain-enabled FL framework designed specifically to enhance resilience against such threats. RFC builds upon the existing Proof of Federated Learning architecture by repurposing the redundancy of its Pooled Mining mechanism as an active defense layer that can be combined with robust aggregation rules. Furthermore, the framework introduces a flexible evaluation function in its consensus mechanism, allowing for adaptive defense against different attack strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation on image classification tasks under various adversarial scenarios, demonstrates that RFC significantly improves robustness compared to baseline methods, providing a viable solution for securing decentralized learning environments.

Abstract: Greybox protocol fuzzing is a random testing approach for stateful protocol implementations, where the input is protocol messages generated from mutations of seeds, and the search in the input space is driven by the feedback on coverage of both code and state. State model and message model are the core components of communication protocols, which also have significant impacts on protocol fuzzing. In this work, we propose APFuzz (Automatic greybox Protocol Fuzzer) with novel designs to increase the smartness of greybox protocol fuzzers from the perspectives of both the state model and the message model. On the one hand, APFuzz employs a two-stage process of static and dynamic analysis to automatically identify state variables, which are then used to infer an accurate state model during fuzzing. On the other hand, APFuzz introduces field-level mutation operations for binary protocols, leveraging message structure awareness enabled by Large Language Models. We conduct extensive experiments on a public protocol fuzzing benchmark, comparing APFuzz with the baseline fuzzer AFLNET as well as several state-of-the-art greybox protocol fuzzers.

Abstract: Threshold Homomorphic Encryption (Threshold HE) is a good fit for implementing private federated average aggregation, a key operation in Federated Learning (FL). Despite its potential, recent studies have shown that threshold schemes available in mainstream HE libraries can introduce unexpected security vulnerabilities if an adversary has access to a restricted decryption oracle. This oracle reflects the FL clients' capacity to collaboratively decrypt the aggregated result without knowing the secret key. This work surveys the use of threshold RLWE-based HE for federated average aggregation and examines the performance impact of using smudging noise with a large variance as a countermeasure. We provide a detailed comparison of threshold variants of BFV and CKKS, finding that CKKS-based aggregations perform comparably to BFV-based solutions.

Abstract: Research on Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in industrial environments requires experimental platforms that support realistic end-to-end attack emulation across converged enterprise IT, operational technology (OT), and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. However, existing industrial cybersecurity testbeds typically focus on isolated IT or OT domains or single-stage attacks, limiting their suitability for studying multi-stage APT campaigns. This paper presents the design, implementation, and validation of SIMPLE-ICS, a virtualised industrial enterprise testbed that enables emulation of multi-stage APT campaigns across IT, OT, and IIoT environments. The testbed architecture is based on the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture, NIST SP 800-82, and IEC 62443 zoning principles and integrates enterprise services, industrial control protocols, and digital twin based process simulation. A systematic methodology inspired by the V model is used to derive architectural requirements, attack scenarios, and validation criteria. An APT campaign designed to mimic the BlackEnergy campaign is emulated using MITRE ATTACK techniques spanning initial enterprise compromise, credential abuse, lateral movement, OT network infiltration, and process manipulation. The testbed supports the synchronised collection of network traffic, host-level logs, and operational telemetry across all segments. The testbed is validated on multi-stage attack trace observability, logging completeness across IT, OT, and IIoT domains, and repeatable execution of APT campaigns. The SIMPLE-ICS testbed provides an experimental platform for studying end-to-end APT behaviours in industrial enterprise networks and for generating multi-source datasets to support future research on campaign-level detection and correlation methods.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) redefines wireless communication from reproducing symbols to transmitting task-relevant semantics. However, this AI-native architecture also introduces new vulnerabilities, as semantic failures may arise from adversarial perturbations to models, corrupted training data, desynchronized priors, or misaligned inference even when lower-layer transmission reliability and cryptographic protection remain intact. This survey provides a defense-centered and system-oriented synthesis of security in SemCom via AI defense. We analyze AI-centric threat models by consolidating existing studies and organizing attack surfaces across model-level, channel-realizable, knowledge-based, and networked inference vectors. Building on this foundation, we present a structured taxonomy of defense strategies organized by where semantic integrity can be compromised in SemCom systems despite correct symbol delivery, spanning semantic encoding, wireless transmission, knowledge integrity, and coordination among multiple agents. These categories correspond to distinct security failure modes, including representation fragility, channel-realizable manipulation, semantic prior poisoning or desynchronization, and adversarial propagation through distributed inference. We also examine security utility operating envelopes that capture tradeoffs among semantic fidelity, robustness, latency, and energy under realistic constraints, survey evaluation frameworks and representative applications, and identify open challenges in cross-layer composition and deployment-time certification. Overall, this survey offers a unified system-level perspective that enables readers to understand major threat and defense mechanisms in AI-native SemCom systems and to leverage emerging security techniques in the design and deployment of robust SemCom architectures for next-generation intelligent networks.

Abstract: Soft set theory provides a direct framework for parameterized decision modeling by assigning to each attribute (parameter) a subset of a given universe, thereby representing uncertainty in a structured way [1, 2]. Over the past decades, the theory has expanded into numerous variants-including hypersoft sets, superhypersoft sets, TreeSoft sets, bipolar soft sets, and dynamic soft sets-and has been connected to diverse areas such as topology and matroid theory. In this book, we present a survey-style overview of soft sets and their major extensions, highlighting core definitions, representative constructions, and key directions of current development.

Abstract: The rapid accumulation of Earth science data has created a significant scalability challenge; while repositories like PANGAEA host vast collections of datasets, citation metrics indicate that a substantial portion remains underutilized, limiting data reusability. Here we present PANGAEA-GPT, a hierarchical multi-agent framework designed for autonomous data discovery and analysis. Unlike standard Large Language Model (LLM) wrappers, our architecture implements a centralized Supervisor-Worker topology with strict data-type-aware routing, sandboxed deterministic code execution, and self-correction via execution feedback, enabling agents to diagnose and resolve runtime errors. Through use-case scenarios spanning physical oceanography and ecology, we demonstrate the system's capacity to execute complex, multi-step workflows with minimal human intervention. This framework provides a methodology for querying and analyzing heterogeneous repository data through coordinated agent workflows.

Abstract: While defenses for structured PII are mature, Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new threat: Semantic Sensitive Information (SemSI), where models infer sensitive identity attributes, generate reputation-harmful content, or hallucinate potentially wrong information. The capacity of LLMs to self-regulate these complex, context-dependent sensitive information leaks without destroying utility remains an open scientific question. To address this, we introduce SemSIEdit, an inference-time framework where an agentic "Editor" iteratively critiques and rewrites sensitive spans to preserve narrative flow rather than simply refusing to answer. Our analysis reveals a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier, where this agentic rewriting reduces leakage by 34.6% across all three SemSI categories while incurring a marginal utility loss of 9.8%. We also uncover a Scale-Dependent Safety Divergence: large reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5) achieve safety through constructive expansion (adding nuance), whereas capacity-constrained models revert to destructive truncation (deleting text). Finally, we identify a Reasoning Paradox: while inference-time reasoning increases baseline risk by enabling the model to make deeper sensitive inferences, it simultaneously empowers the defense to execute safe rewrites.

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (ARL) has rapidly gained attention as a promising paradigm for training agents to solve complex, multi-step interactive tasks. Despite encouraging early results, ARL remains highly unstable, often leading to training collapse. This instability limits scalability to larger environments and longer interaction horizons, and constrains systematic exploration of algorithmic design choices. In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL. Empirically, SAMPO achieves consistently stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks. Overall, this study provides a unifying policy gradient perspective for ARL and offers practical guidance for building stable and reproducible LLM-based agent training pipelines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: When designing compound AI systems, a common approach is to query multiple copies of the same model and aggregate the responses to produce a synthesized output. Given the homogeneity of these models, this raises the question of whether aggregation unlocks access to a greater set of outputs than querying a single model. In this work, we investigate the power and limitations of aggregation within a stylized principal-agent framework. This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agent's output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our findings for LLMs deployed in a toy reference-generation task. Altogether, our results take a step towards characterizing when compound AI systems can overcome limitations in model capabilities and in prompt engineering.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce the ASIR (Awakened Shared Intelligence Relationship) Courage Model, a phase-dynamic framework that formalizes truth-disclosure as a state transition rather than a personality trait. The mode characterizes the shift from suppression (S0) to expression (S1) as occurring when facilitative forces exceed inhibitory thresholds, expressed by the inequality lambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi, where the terms represent baseline openness, relational amplification, accumulated internal pressure, and transition costs.
  Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion.
  A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions. Rather than attributing intention to AI systems, the model interprets shifts in apparent truthfulness as geometric consequences of interacting forces within constrained phase space. By reframing courage and alignment within a shared dynamical structure, the ASIR Courage Model offers a formal perspective on truth-disclosure under risk across both human and artificial systems.

Abstract: In a previous work, we introduced the fuzzy Ethical Decision-Making framework (fEDM), a risk-based ethical reasoning architecture grounded in fuzzy logic. The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM+, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models consistently fail the "car wash problem," a viral reasoning benchmark requiring implicit physical constraint inference. We present a variable isolation study (n=20 per condition, 6 conditions, 120 total trials) examining which prompt architecture layers in a production system enable correct reasoning. Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet with controlled hyperparameters (temperature 0.7, top_p 1.0), we find that the STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) reasoning framework alone raises accuracy from 0% to 85% (p=0.001, Fisher's exact test, odds ratio 13.22). Adding user profile context via vector database retrieval provides a further 10 percentage point gain, while RAG context contributes an additional 5 percentage points, achieving 100% accuracy in the full-stack condition. These results suggest that structured reasoning scaffolds -- specifically, forced goal articulation before inference -- matter substantially more than context injection for implicit constraint reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Complex claim verification requires decomposing sentences into verifiable subclaims, yet existing methods struggle to align decomposition quality with verification performance. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that jointly optimizes decomposition quality and verifier alignment using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method integrates: (i) structured sequential reasoning; (ii) supervised finetuning on teacher-distilled exemplars; and (iii) a multi-objective reward balancing format compliance, verifier alignment, and decomposition quality. Across six evaluation settings, our trained 8B decomposer improves downstream verification performance to (71.75%) macro-F1, outperforming prompt-based approaches ((+1.99), (+6.24)) and existing RL methods ((+5.84)). Human evaluation confirms the high quality of the generated subclaims. Our framework enables smaller language models to achieve state-of-the-art claim verification by jointly optimising for verification accuracy and decomposition quality.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in mobile agent development, yet their capabilities are predominantly confined to a reactive paradigm, where they merely execute explicit user commands. The emerging paradigm of proactive intelligence, where agents autonomously anticipate needs and initiate actions, represents the next frontier for mobile agents. However, its development is critically bottlenecked by the lack of benchmarks that can address real-world complexity and enable objective, executable evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ProactiveMobile, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically advance research in this domain. ProactiveMobile formalizes the proactive task as inferring latent user intent across four dimensions of on-device contextual signals and generating an executable function sequence from a comprehensive function pool of 63 APIs. The benchmark features over 3,660 instances of 14 scenarios that embrace real-world complexity through multi-answer annotations. To ensure quality, a team of 30 experts conducts a final audit of the benchmark, verifying factual accuracy, logical consistency, and action feasibility, and correcting any non-compliant entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct achieves a success rate of 19.15%, outperforming o1 (15.71%) and GPT-5 (7.39%). This result indicates that proactivity is a critical competency widely lacking in current MLLMs, yet it is learnable, emphasizing the importance of the proposed benchmark for proactivity evaluation.

Abstract: Across a growing number of fields, human decision making is supported by predictions from AI models. However, we still lack a deep understanding of the effects of adoption of these technologies. In this paper, we introduce a general computational framework, the 2-Step Agent, which models the effects of AI-assisted decision making. Our framework uses Bayesian methods for causal inference to model 1) how a prediction on a new observation affects the beliefs of a rational Bayesian agent, and 2) how this change in beliefs affects the downstream decision and subsequent outcome. Using this framework, we show by simulations how a single misaligned prior belief can be sufficient for decision support to result in worse downstream outcomes compared to no decision support. Our results reveal several potential pitfalls of AI-driven decision support and highlight the need for thorough model documentation and proper user training.

Abstract: Grounding is a critical step in classical planning, yet it often becomes a computational bottleneck due to the exponential growth in grounded actions and atoms as task size increases. Recent advances in partial grounding have addressed this challenge by incrementally grounding only the most promising operators, guided by predictive models. However, these approaches primarily rely on relational features or learned embeddings and do not leverage the textual and structural cues present in PDDL descriptions. We propose SPG-LLM, which uses LLMs to analyze the domain and problem files to heuristically identify potentially irrelevant objects, actions, and predicates prior to grounding, significantly reducing the size of the grounded task. Across seven hard-to-ground benchmarks, SPG-LLM achieves faster grounding-often by orders of magnitude-while delivering comparable or better plan costs in some domains.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in decision-making tasks that require them to process information from a variety of sources, including both human experts and other algorithmic agents. How do LLMs weigh the information provided by these different sources? We consider the well-studied phenomenon of algorithm aversion, in which human decision-makers exhibit bias against predictions from algorithms. Drawing upon experimental paradigms from behavioural economics, we evaluate how eightdifferent LLMs delegate decision-making tasks when the delegatee is framed as a human expert or an algorithmic agent. To be inclusive of different evaluation formats, we conduct our study with two task presentations: stated preferences, modeled through direct queries about trust towards either agent, and revealed preferences, modeled through providing in-context examples of the performance of both agents. When prompted to rate the trustworthiness of human experts and algorithms across diverse tasks, LLMs give higher ratings to the human expert, which correlates with prior results from human respondents. However, when shown the performance of a human expert and an algorithm and asked to place an incentivized bet between the two, LLMs disproportionately choose the algorithm, even when it performs demonstrably worse. These discrepant results suggest that LLMs may encode inconsistent biases towards humans and algorithms, which need to be carefully considered when they are deployed in high-stakes scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity of LLMs to task presentation formats that should be broadly scrutinized in evaluation robustness for AI safety.

Abstract: Plans often change due to changes in the situation or our understanding of the situation. Sometimes, a feasible plan may not even exist, and identifying such infeasibilities is useful to determine when requirements need adjustment. Common planning approaches focus on efficient one-shot planning in feasible cases rather than updating domains or detecting infeasibility. We propose a Petri net reachability relaxation to enable robust invariant synthesis, efficient goal-unreachability detection, and helpful infeasibility explanations. We further leverage incremental constraint solvers to support goal and constraint updates. Empirically, compared to baselines, our system produces a comparable number of invariants, detects up to 2 times more infeasibilities, performs competitively in one-shot planning, and outperforms in sequential plan updates in the tested domains.

We present AgenticTyper, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic system that addresses these gaps through iterative error correction and behavior preservation via transpilation comparison. Evaluation on two proprietary repositories (81K LOC) shows that AgenticTyper resolves all 633 initial type errors in 20 minutes, reducing manual effort from one working day.

Abstract: Developer Productivity Dashboards are essential for visualizing DevOps performance metrics such as Deployment Frequency and Change Failure Rate (DORA). However, the utility of these dashboards is frequently undermined by data reliability issues. In early iterations of our platform, ad-hoc ingestion scripts (Cron jobs) led to "silent failures," where data gaps went undetected for days, eroding organizational trust. This paper reports on our experience migrating from legacy scheduling to a robust Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) pipeline using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) orchestration and Medallion Architecture. We detail the operational benefits of decoupling data extraction from transformation, the necessity of immutable raw history for metric redefinition, and the implementation of state-based dependency management. Our experience suggests that treating the metrics pipeline as a production-grade distributed system is a prerequisite for sustainable engineering analytics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential as autonomous software engineering (SWE) agents. Recent work has further explored augmenting these agents with memory mechanisms to support long-horizon reasoning. However, these approaches typically operate at a coarse instance granularity, treating the entire problem-solving episode as the atomic unit of storage and retrieval. We empirically demonstrate that instance-level memory suffers from a fundamental granularity mismatch, resulting in misguided retrieval when tasks with similar surface descriptions require distinct reasoning logic at specific stages. To address this, we propose Structurally Aligned Subtask-Level Memory, a method that aligns memory storage, retrieval, and updating with the agent's functional decomposition. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both vanilla agents and strong instance-level memory baselines across diverse backbones, improving mean Pass@1 over the vanilla agent by +4.7 pp on average (e.g., +6.8 pp on Gemini 2.5 Pro). Performance gains grow with more interaction steps, showing that leveraging past experience benefits long-horizon reasoning in complex software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Uncertainty is inherent in modern engineered systems, including cyber-physical systems, autonomous systems, and large-scale software-intensive infrastructures (such as microservice-based systems) operating in dynamic and partially observable environments. The recent publication of Precise Semantics for Uncertainty Modeling (PSUM) by the Object Management Group represents the first standardized specification for uncertainty modeling within the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) community, providing formally defined semantics for representing and reasoning about uncertainty in models. In parallel, the second version of Systems Modeling Language (SysML v2) was released as the next-generation systems modeling language, offering improved semantic rigor and reusability, yet lacking native constructs aligned with PSUM for first-class uncertainty representation. This paper proposes a systematic extension of SysML v2 that incorporates the PSUM metamodel into its modeling framework. The extension enables explicit specification of indeterminacy sources, structured characterization of uncertainties, and consistent propagation of uncertainty within system models, while preserving conformance with SysML v2 syntax and semantics. We validate the approach through seven case studies. Results demonstrate that the proposed extension (PSUM-SysMLv2) is expressive and applicable for uncertainty-aware MBSE, and potentially enables uncertainty and uncertainty propagation analyses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code editing have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent empirical studies reveal a fundamental disconnect between technical accuracy and developer productivity. Despite their strong benchmark performance, developers complete tasks 19% slower when using AI assistance, with over 68.81% of recommendations disrupting their mental flow. This misalignment stems from the use of static commit snapshots that lack temporal information, causing models to optimize for end results rather than the incremental, context-sensitive steps that align with developers' natural reasoning process.
  To bridge this gap, we present EditFlow, which benchmarks and optimizes subsequent code edit recommendation systems through the reconstruction of developer editing flows. EditFlow addresses three key challenges. First, collecting edit-order data that reflects developers' flow is inherently difficult: manual annotation introduces prohibitive overhead, while development logs capture only single trajectories instead of all plausible editing flows. Second, benchmarking recommendation performance against developers' ongoing editing flow requires a digital-twin-like simulation that can faithfully simulate the editing process. Third, existing heterogeneous systems vary drastically in scale and architecture, posing challenges for developing a unified optimization strategy that endows all models with mental-flow awareness regardless of design or capability.

Abstract: Prototyping plays a critical role in the development of machine learning (ML) solutions, yet existing tools often provide limited support for effective collaboration and knowledge reuse among stakeholders. This paper introduces Proto-ML, an IDE designed to strengthen ML prototyping workflows. By addressing key deficiencies such as insufficient stakeholder involvement, limited cross-project knowledge reuse, and fragmented tool support, Proto-ML offers a unified framework that enables structured documentation of prototyping activities and promotes knowledge sharing across projects.
  The Proto-ML IDE consists of three extension bundles: prototype implementation, analysis, and knowledge management. These extensions support tasks ranging from evaluating prototype quality against defined criteria to incorporating stakeholder perspectives throughout the development process. Preliminary user feedback suggests that Proto-ML can increase prototyping efficiency and foster more transparent and reusable ML solution development.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to a significant increase in automated tools in the software engineering, capable of performing various code-related tasks such as code generation, completion, and translation. Despite these advancements, its effectiveness is constrained by fixed context lengths, limiting its ability to generalize across long, domain-specific code sequences. To address this challenge, we investigate zero-shot, inference-only methods aimed at improving position encodings and optimizing attention mechanisms. Our goal is to provide a thorough analysis of current approaches that facilitate context length extrapolation in code, particularly in the context of long code completion tasks.

Abstract: LLM agents have been widely adopted in real-world applications, relying on agent frameworks for workflow execution and multi-agent coordination. As these systems scale, understanding bugs in the underlying agent frameworks becomes critical. However, existing work mainly focuses on agent-level failures, overlooking framework-level bugs. To address this gap, we conduct an empirical study of 998 bug reports from CrewAI and LangChain, constructing a taxonomy of 15 root causes and 7 observable symptoms across five agent lifecycle stages: 'Agent Initialization','Perception', 'Self-Action', 'Mutual Interaction' and 'Evolution'. Our findings show that agent framework bugs mainly arise from 'API misuse', 'API incompatibility', and 'Documentation Desync', largely concentrated in the 'Self-Action' stage. Symptoms typically appear as 'Functional Error', 'Crash', and 'Build Failure', reflecting disruptions to task progression and control flow.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for automated code refactoring tasks. Although these models can quickly refactor code, the quality may exhibit inconsistencies and unpredictable behavior. In this article, we systematically study the capabilities of LLMs for code refactoring with a specific focus on improving code readability.
  We conducted a large-scale experiment using GPT5.1 with 230 Java snippets, each systematically varied and refactored regarding code readability across five iterations under three different prompting strategies. We categorized fine-grained code changes during the refactoring into implementation, syntactic, and comment-level transformations. Subsequently, we investigated the functional correctness and tested the robustness of the results with novel snippets.
  Our results reveal three main insights: First, iterative code refactoring exhibits an initial phase of restructuring followed by stabilization. This convergence tendency suggests that LLMs possess an internalized understanding of an "optimally readable" version of code. Second, convergence patterns are fairly robust across different code variants. Third, explicit prompting toward specific readability factors slightly influences the refactoring dynamics.
  These insights provide an empirical foundation for assessing the reliability of LLM-assisted code refactoring, which opens pathways for future research, including comparative analyses across models and a systematic evaluation of additional software quality dimensions in LLM-refactored code.

Abstract: Automated test generation is essential for software quality assurance, with coverage rate serving as a key metric to ensure thorough testing. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving test generation, particularly in achieving higher coverage. However, while existing LLM-based test generation solutions perform well on small, isolated code snippets, they struggle when applied to complex methods under test. To address these issues, we propose a scalable LLM-based unit test generation method. Our approach consists of two key steps. The first step is context information retrieval, which uses both LLMs and static analysis to gather relevant contextual information associated with the complex methods under test. The second step, iterative test generation with code elimination, repeatedly generates unit tests for the code slice, tracks the achieved coverage, and selectively removes code segments that have already been covered. This process simplifies the testing task and mitigates issues arising from token limits or reduced reasoning effectiveness associated with excessively long contexts. Through comprehensive evaluations on open-source projects, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and search-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving high coverage on complex methods.

Abstract: Integrated Development Environments shape developers' daily experience, yet the empirical study of their usability and user experience (UX) remains limited. This work presents an LLM-assisted approach to detecting UX smells in Visual Studio Code by mining and classifying user-reported issues from the GitHub repository. Using a validated taxonomy and expert review, we identified recurring UX problems that affect the developer experience. Our results show that the majority of UX smells are concentrated in informativeness, clarity, intuitiveness, and efficiency, qualities that developers value most.

Abstract: This paper explains the Visual Milestone Planning (VMP) method using an agile vocabulary to facilitate its adoption by agile practitioners as a front end for a hybrid development process. VMP is a visual and collaborative planning approach which promotes a shared understanding of the work approach and commitment through the direct manipulation by team members of the reified planning constructs involved in the development of the plan. Once the product backlog has been established and relevant milestones identified, a novel construct called the milestone planning matrix is used to document the allocation of product backlog items to milestones. The milestones due dates are later determined by grouping sticky notes representing the work to be performed into time-boxes called work packages and accommodating them on a resource and time scaled scheduling canvas very much as it would be done in a Tetris game.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in cost, latency, and adaptability, but have so far lagged behind larger models on long-horizon software engineering tasks such as SWE-bench, where they suffer from pervasive action looping and low resolution rates. We introduce SWE-Protégé, a post-training framework that reframes software repair as an expert-protégé collaboration problem. In SWE-Protégé, an SLM remains the sole decision-maker while learning to selectively seek guidance from a strong expert model, recognize stalled states, and follow through on expert feedback. Our approach combines supervised fine-tuning on expert-augmented trajectories with agentic reinforcement learning that explicitly discourages degenerative looping and unproductive expert collaboration. We lightly post-train Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct to achieve 42.4% Pass@1 on SWE-bench Verified, a +25.4% improvement over the prior SLM state of the art, while using expert assistance sparsely (~4 calls per task and 11% of total tokens).
