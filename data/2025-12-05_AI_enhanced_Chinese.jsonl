While an abundance of methods for suppressing sensitive data exist, the conceptualization of sensitive data and methods to detect it, focus particularly on personal data that, if disclosed, may be harmful or violate privacy. We observe the need for refining and broadening our definitions of sensitive data, and argue that the sensitivity of data depends on its context. Based on this definition, we introduce two mechanisms for contextual sensitive data detection that con- sider the broader context of a dataset at hand. First, we introduce type contextualization, which first detects the semantic type of particular data values, then considers the overall context of the data values within the dataset or document. Second, we introduce domain contextualization which determines sensitivity of a given dataset in the broader context based on the retrieval of relevant rules from documents that specify data sensitivity (e.g., data topic and geographic origin). Experiments with these mechanisms, assisted by large language models (LLMs), confirm that: 1) type-contextualization significantly reduces the number of false positives for type-based sensitive data detection and reaches a recall of 94% compared to 63% with commercial tools, and 2) domain-contextualization leveraging sensitivity rule retrieval is effective for context-grounded sensitive data detection in non-standard data domains such as humanitarian datasets. Evaluation with humanitarian data experts also reveals that context-grounded LLM explanations provide useful guidance in manual data auditing processes, improving consistency.

Yet, users typically see only the final answer, not the underlying reasoning. One of these reasoning models is gpt-oss, which can be deployed locally, providing full access to its underlying reasoning process. This article presents the first investigation into the potential of reasoning language models for digital forensics. Four test use cases are examined to assess the usability of the reasoning component in supporting result explainability. The evaluation combines a new quantitative metric with qualitative analysis.

However, its effectiveness depends heavily on the selection and quality of in-context examples, particularly in complex domains. In this work, we examine retrieval-augmented prompting as a strategy to improve few-shot performance in code vulnerability detection, where the goal is to identify one or more security-relevant weaknesses present in a given code snippet from a predefined set of vulnerability categories. We perform a systematic evaluation using the Gemini-1.5-Flash model across three approaches: (1) standard few-shot prompting with randomly selected examples, (2) retrieval-augmented prompting using semantically similar examples, and (3) retrieval-based labeling, which assigns labels based on retrieved examples without model inference. Our results show that retrieval-augmented prompting consistently outperforms the other prompting strategies. At 20 shots, it achieves an F1 score of 74.05% and a partial match accuracy of 83.90%.

Although training is energy-intensive, the long-term environmental burden arises from inference, amplified by the massive global query volume. Cloud-based inference offers scalability but suffers from latency and bandwidth constraints due to centralized processing and continuous data transfer. Edge clusters instead can mitigate these limitations by enabling localized execution, yet they face trade-offs between performance, energy efficiency, and device constraints. This short paper presents a sustainability-aware LLM inference for edge clusters comprising NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX (8GB) and Nvidia Ada 2000 (16GB) devices. It aims to balance inference latency and carbon footprint through carbon- and latency-aware routing strategies, guided by empirical benchmarking of energy consumption and execution time across diverse prompts and batch (i.e., group of prompts) configurations. We compared baseline greedy strategies to carbon-aware and latency-aware strategies in prompt routing to specific hardware based on benchmarking information. Experimental evaluation shows that a batch size of four prompts achieves a trade-off between throughput, energy efficiency, while larger batches risk GPU memory saturation.", "AI": {"tldr": "True", "motivation": "True", "method": "True", "result": "True", "conclusion": "True"}}

While complete methods like backtracking guarantee a solution, their exponential time complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances thus, stochastic approaches, such as Las Vegas algorithm, are preferred. While it offers faster approximate solutions, it suffers from significant performance variance due to random placement of queens on the board. This research introduces a hybrid algorithm built on top of the standard Las Vegas framework through iterative pruning, dynamically eliminating invalid placements during the random assignment phase, thus this method effectively reduces the search space. The analysis results that traditional backtracking scales poorly with increasing N. In contrast, the proposed technique consistently generates valid solutions more rapidly, establishing it as a superior alternative to use where a single, timely solution is preferred over completeness. Although large N causes some performance variability, the algorithm demonstrates a highly effective trade-off between computational cost and solution fidelity, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained computing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "true", "motivation": "true", "method": "true", "result": "true", "conclusion": "true"}}

However, its performance and stability depend heavily on factors such as startup overhead, runtime execution model (e.g., Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation), and resource variability across deployment contexts. This paper evaluates a Wasm-based serverless workflow executed consistently from the browser to edge and cloud instances. The setup uses wasm32-wasi modules: in the browser, execution occurs within a web worker, while on Edge and Cloud, an HTTP shim streams frames to the Wasm runtime. We measure cold- and warm-start latency, per-step delays, workflow makespan, throughput, and CPU/memory utilization to capture the end-to-end behavior across environments. Results show that AOT compilation and instance warming substantially reduce startup latency.

Existing exploitation frameworks depend on identifying highly-constrained structures in the host machine and accurately determining their runtime addresses, which is ineffective in hypervisor environments where such structures are rare and further obfuscated by Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). We instead observe that modern virtualization environments exhibit weak memory isolation -- guest memory is fully attacker-controlled yet accessible from the host, providing a reliable primitive for exploitation. Based on this observation, we present the first systematic characterization and taxonomy of Cross-Domain Attacks (CDA), a class of exploitation techniques that enable capability escalation through guest memory reuse. To automate this process, we develop a system that identifies cross-domain gadgets, matches them with corrupted pointers, synthesizes triggering inputs, and assembles complete exploit chains. Our evaluation on 15 real-world vulnerabilities across QEMU and VirtualBox shows that CDA is widely applicable and effective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u865a\u62df\u5316\u73af\u5883\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5229\u7528\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u865a\u62df\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f31\u5185\u5b58\u9694\u79bb\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u653b\u51fb\uff08CDA\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u865a\u62df\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5229\u7528\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5730\u5740\u968f\u673a\u5316\uff08ASLR\uff09\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u653b\u51fb\uff08CDA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5229\u7528guest\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6570\u636e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5339\u914d\u3001\u5408\u6210\u89e6\u53d1\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u7ec4\u88c5\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u94fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728QEMU\u548cVirtualBox\u768415\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CDA\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CDA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u865a\u62df\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5229\u7528\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u3002"}}

Depending on the type of twinning occurring, it is either trivial, such as in dashboarding/visualizations that mirror the system with real-time data, or challenging, in case the digital twin is a simulation model that reflects the behavior of a physical twinned system. The challenge in this latter case comes from the fact that in contrast to software systems, physical systems are not immutable once deployed, but instead they evolve through processes like maintenance, wear and tear or user error. It is therefore important to detect when changes occur in the physical system to evolve the twin alongside it. We employ and reuse validation techniques from model-based design for this goal. Model validation is one of the steps used to gain trust in the representativeness of a simulation model. In this work, we provide two contributions: (i) we provide a generic approach that, through the use of validation metrics, is able to detect anomalies in twinned systems, and (ii) we demonstrate these techniques with the help of an academic yet industrially relevant case study of a gantry crane such as found in ports. Treating anomalies also means correcting the error in the digital twin, which we do with a parameter estimation based on the historical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this demand, fog and edge computing have emerged as distributed paradigms that bring computational resources closer to end users, reducing latency, bandwidth limitations, and energy consumption. However, these paradigms present challenges in resource management due to resource constraints, computational heterogeneity, dynamic workloads, and diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art resource management strategies in microservices-based fog and edge computing, focusing on energy-efficient solutions. We systematically review and classify more than 136 studies (2020-2024) into five key subdomains: service placement, resource provisioning, task scheduling and offloading, resource allocation, and instance selection. Our categorization is based on optimization techniques, targeted objectives, and the strengths and limitations of each approach. In addition, we examine existing surveys and identify unresolved challenges and gaps in the literature. By highlighting the lack of synergy among fundamental resource management components, we outline promising research directions leveraging AI-driven optimization, quantum computing, and serverless computing. This survey serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners by providing a unified and energy-aware perspective on resource management in microservices-based fog and edge computing, paving the way for more integrated, efficient, and sustainable future solutions.", "AI": {"tldr":

Current approaches, however, overlook two critical challenges: robustness against adversarial source code transformations and adaptability to the varying false positive rate (FPR) requirements of different actors, from repository maintainers (requiring low FPR) to enterprise security teams (higher FPR tolerance).\n  We introduce a robust detector capable of seamless integration into both public repositories like PyPI and enterprise ecosystems. To ensure robustness, we propose a novel methodology for generating adversarial packages using fine-grained code obfuscation. Combining these with adversarial training (AT) enhances detector robustness by 2.5x. We comprehensively evaluate AT effectiveness by testing our detector against 122,398 packages collected daily from PyPI over 80 days, showing that AT needs careful application: it makes the detector more robust to obfuscations and allows finding 10% more obfuscated packages, but slightly decreases performance on non-obfuscated packages.\n  We demonstrate production adaptability of our detector via two case studies: (i) one for PyPI maintainers (tuned at 0.1% FPR) and (ii) one for enterprise teams (tuned at 10% FPR). In the former, we analyze 91,949 packages collected from PyPI over 37 days, achieving a daily detection rate of 2.48 malicious packages with only 2.18 false positives. In the latter, we analyze 1,596 packages adopted by a multinational software company, obtaining only 1.24 false positives daily. These results show that our detector can be seamlessly integrated into both public repositories like PyPI and enterprise ecosystems, ensuring a very low time budget of a few minutes to review the false positives.\n  Overall, we uncovered 346 malicious packages, now reported to the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u62b5\u5fa1\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u6362\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u7ec7/\u89d2\u8272\u5bf9\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\uff08FPR\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6076\u610fPython\u5305\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7801\u6df7\u6dc6\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862.5\u500d\uff0c\u572880\u5929\u5185\u9488\u5bf9122,398\u4e2aPyPI\u5305\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u53d1\u73b010%\u66f4\u591a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u6076\u610f\u5305\uff0c\u4f46\u7a0d\u5fae\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u975e\u6df7\u6dc6\u5305\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff08\u5bf991,949\u4e2a\u5305\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c37\u5929\u5185\u6bcf\u5929\u68c0\u51fa2.48\u4e2a\u6076\u610f\u5305\u5e76\u67092.18\u4e2a\u5047\u9633\u6027\uff1b\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a1,596\u4e2a\u5305\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bcf\u5929\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f1.24\u4e2a\u5047\u9633\u6027\uff09\u3002\u5171\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86346\u4e2a\u6076\u610f\u5305\u5e76\u5411\u793e\u533a\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u516c\u5171\u4ee3\u7801\u4ed3\u5e93\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u8981\u6c42\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4e3aPython\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Investigation processes followed by on-call engineers are often manual or rely on ad-hoc scripts. This leads to inefficient investigations resulting in increased time to mitigate and isolate failures/SLO violations. It also contributes to on-call toil and poor productivity leading to multiple hours/days spent in triaging/debugging incidents. In this paper, we present DrP, an end-to-end framework and system to automate investigations that reduces the mean time to resolve incidents (MTTR) and reduces on-call toil. DrP consists of an expressive and flexible SDK to author investigation playbooks in code (called analyzers), a scalable backend system to execute these automated playbooks, plug-ins to integrate playbooks into mainstream workflows such as alerts and incident management tools, and a post-processing system to take actions on investigations including mitigation steps.\n  We have implemented and deployed DrP at large scale at Meta covering 300+ teams, 2000+ analyzers, across a large set of use cases across domains such as services, core infrastructure, AI/ML, hardware, mobile. DrP has been running in production for the past 5 years and executes 50K automated analyses per day. Overall, our results and experience show that DrP has been able to reduce average MTTR by 20 percent at large scale (with over 80 percent for some teams) and has significantly improved on-call productivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "DrP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u67e5\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8b\u6545\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\uff08MTTR\uff09\u548c\u5f85\u547d\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u5b83\u7531\u7075\u6d3b\u7684SDK\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u540e\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u63d2\u4ef6\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u91c7\u53d6\u8865\u6551\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4eba\u5de5\u6216adhoc\u811a\u672c\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8c03\u67e5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u6545\u969c\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8017\u8d39\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5927\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7cbe\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6539\u5584\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "DrP\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684SDK\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u540e\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684'\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e66'\uff08analyzers\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8b66\u62a5\u548c\u4e8b\u6545\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u7684\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u5904\u7406\u8865\u6551\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "DrP\u5728Meta\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5305\u62ec300\u591a\u4e2a\u56e2\u961f\uff0c2000+ analyzers\u3002DrP\u6bcf\u5929\u6267\u884c50K\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5e73\u5747MTTR\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8620%\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u56e2\u961f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8680%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u5f85\u547d\u5de5\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DrP\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u4f4e\u4e86MTTR\u548c\u5f85\u547d\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Data originating from a producer must be delivered to consumers, potentially distributed in clusters across metropolitan and continental boundaries. With the growing scale of computing, there can be several thousand consumers of the data. Such systems require a robust messaging system capable of transmitting messages containing data across clusters and efficiently delivering them to consumers. The system must offer guarantees like ordering and at-least-once delivery while avoiding overload on consumers, allowing them to consume messages at their own pace.\n  This paper presents the design of Fast ACS (an abbreviation for Ads Copy Service), a file-based ordered message delivery system that leverages a combination of two-sided (inter-cluster) and one-sided (intra-cluster) communication primitives - namely, Remote Procedure Call and Remote Memory Access, respectively - to deliver messages. The system has been successfully deployed to dozens of production clusters and scales to accommodate several thousand consumers within each cluster, which amounts to Tbps-scale intra-cluster consumer traffic at peak. Notably, Fast ACS delivers messages to consumers across the globe within a few seconds or even sub-seconds (p99) based on the message volume and consumer scale, at a low resource cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fast ACS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\uff0c\u5229\u7528RPC\u548cRMA\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5728\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u751f\u4ea7\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u6570\u5343\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u8ff0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4ee5\u53ca\u968f\u4e4b\u800c\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f15\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5065\u6d88\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Fast ACS\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u7aef\uff08\u96c6\u7fa4\u95f4\uff09\u548c\u5355\u8fb9\uff08\u96c6\u7fa4\u5185\uff09\u901a\u4fe1\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u5373\u8fdc\u7a0b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8c03\u7528\uff08RPC\uff09\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\uff08RMA\uff09\u3002", "result": "Fast ACS\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u751f\u4ea7\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u6bcf\u4e2a\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u65f6\u751a\u81f3\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230Tbps\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\u5185\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u6d41\u91cf\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u51e0\u79d2\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\uff08p99\uff09\u5c06\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u5168\u7403\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u3002", "conclusion": "Fast ACS\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528RPC\u548cRMA\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing methods,such as rule-based intrusion detection and static vulnerability scanning, are inadequate and unreceptive to changes in the system, causing longer response times and organization needs exposure to emerging attack vectors. In light of the previous constraints, we introduce AutoGuard to the DevSecOps ecosystem, a reinforcement learning (RL)-powered self-healing security framework built to pre-emptively protect DevSecOps environments. AutoGuard is a self-securing security environment that continuously observes pipeline activities for potential anomalies while preemptively remediating the environment. The model observes and reacts based on a policy that is continually learned dynamically over time. The RL agent improves each action over time through reward-based learning aimed at improving the agent's ability to prevent, detect and respond to a security incident in real-time. Testing using simulated ContinuousIntegration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) environments showed AutoGuard to successfully improve threat detection accuracy by 22%, reduce mean time torecovery (MTTR) for incidents by 38% and increase overall resilience to incidents as compared to traditional methods.\n  Keywords- DevSecOps, Reinforcement Learning, Self- Healing Security, Continuous Integration, Automated Threat Mitigation", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoGuard\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4DevSecOps\u73af\u5883\u514d\u53d7\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9759\u6001\u6f0f\u6d1e\u626b\u63cf\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u663e\u5f97\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u653b\u51fb\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AutoGuard\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ba1\u9053\u6d3b\u52a8\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u5373\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7684CI/CD\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0cAutoGuard\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8622%\uff0c\u5c06\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6062\u590d\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u65f6\u95f4\uff08MTTR\uff09\u7f29\u77ed\u4e8638%\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u4f53\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62b5\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoGuard\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u9632\u62a4\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86DevSecOps\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

The rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot has transformed how software is learned and written. In software engineering (SE) education, these tools offer new opportunities for support, but also raise concerns about over-reliance, ethical use, and impacts on learning. Objective. This study investigates how undergraduate SE students use GenAI tools, focusing on the benefits, challenges, ethical concerns, and instructional expectations that shape their experiences. Method. We conducted a survey with 130 undergraduate students from two universities. The survey combined structured Likert-scale items and open-ended questions to investigate five dimensions: usage context, perceived benefits, challenges, ethical and instructional perceptions. Results. Students most often use GenAI for incremental learning and advanced implementation, reporting benefits such as brainstorming support and confidence-building.

However, this reuse of prior designs also leads to similar vulnerabilities across multiple processors. As processors grow increasingly complex with iterative modifications, efficiently detecting vulnerabilities from modern processors is critical. Inspired by software fuzzing, hardware fuzzing has recently demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting processor vulnerabilities. Yet, to our best knowledge, existing processor fuzzers fuzz each design individually, lacking the capability to understand known vulnerabilities in prior processors to fine-tune fuzzing to identify similar or new variants of vulnerabilities.\n  To address this gap, we present ReFuzz, an adaptive fuzzing framework that leverages contextual bandit to reuse highly effective tests from prior processors to fuzz a processor-under-test (PUT) within a given ISA. By intelligently mutating tests that trigger vulnerabilities in prior processors, ReFuzz effectively detects similar and new variants of vulnerabilities in PUTs. ReFuzz uncovered three new security vulnerabilities and two new functional bugs. ReFuzz detected one vulnerability by reusing a test that triggers a known vulnerability in a prior processor. One functional bug exists across three processors that share design modules. The second bug has two variants.

DOI: 10.1109/VL-HCC65237.2025.00024", "summary": "Usability evaluations are essential for ensuring that modern interfaces meet user needs, yet traditional heuristic evaluations by human experts can be time-consuming and subjective, especially early in development. This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can provide reliable and consistent heuristic assessments at the development stage. By applying Jakob Nielsen's ten usability heuristics to thirty open-source websites, we generated over 850 heuristic evaluations in three independent evaluations per site using a pipeline of OpenAI's GPT-4o. For issue detection, the model demonstrated moderate consistency, with an average pairwise Cohen's Kappa of 0.50 and an exact agreement of 84%. Severity judgments showed more variability: weighted Cohen's Kappa averaged 0.63, but exact agreement was just 56%, and Krippendorff's Alpha was near zero. These results suggest that while GPT-4o can produce internally consistent evaluations, especially for identifying the presence of usability issues, its ability to judge severity varies and requires human oversight in practice. Our findings highlight the feasibility and limitations of using LLMs for early-stage, automated usability testing, and offer a foundation for improving consistency in automated User Experience (UX) evaluation.

Yet their training paradigms remain dominated by affirmation-based inference, akin to \\textit{modus ponens}, where accepted premises yield predicted consequents. While effective for generative fluency, this one-directional approach leaves models vulnerable to logical fallacies, adversarial manipulation, and failures in causal reasoning. This paper makes two contributions. First, it demonstrates how existing LLMs from major platforms exhibit systematic weaknesses when reasoning in scientific domains with negation, counterexamples, or faulty premises \\footnote{Code to recreate these experiments are at https://github.com/hannahdavidsoncollege-maker/ScientificReasoningForEnvironment-MedicineWithLLMs. Second, it introduces a dual-reasoning training framework that integrates affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial. Grounded in formal logic, cognitive science, and adversarial training, this training paradigm formalizes a computational analogue of ``denying the antecedent'' as a mechanism for disconfirmation and robustness. By coupling generative synthesis with explicit negation-aware objectives, the framework enables models that not only affirm valid inferences but also reject invalid ones, yielding systems that are more resilient, interpretable, and aligned with human reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u80af\u5b9a\u4e0e\u5426\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53cc\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9762\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u3001\u53cd\u4f8b\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u524d\u63d0\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6613\u53d7\u903b\u8f91\u8c2c\u8bef\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u80af\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5426\u5b9a\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u5426\u8ba4\u524d\u4ef6\u201d\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u786e\u8ba4\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u8bba\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u62d2\u7edd\u65e0\u6548\u63a8\u8bba\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5177\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Such privately adapted LLMs are regarded as either personal privacy assets or corporate intellectual property. Therefore, protecting model weights and maintaining strict confidentiality during deployment and distribution have become critically important. However, existing model formats and deployment frameworks provide little to no built-in support for confidentiality, access control, or secure integration with trusted hardware. Current methods for securing model deployment either rely on computationally expensive cryptographic techniques or tightly controlled private infrastructure. Although these approaches can be effective in specific scenarios, they are difficult and costly for widespread deployment.\n  In this paper, we introduce CryptoTensors, a secure and format-compatible file structure for confidential LLM distribution. Built as an extension to the widely adopted Safetensors format, CryptoTensors incorporates tensor-level encryption and embedded access control policies, while preserving critical features such as lazy loading and partial deserialization. It enables transparent decryption and automated key management, supporting flexible licensing and secure model execution with minimal overhead. We implement a proof-of-concept library, benchmark its performance across serialization and runtime scenarios, and validate its compatibility with existing inference frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM.

The main innovation is a flexible sampling scheme in which two independent parameters are drawn from user defined domains and mapped to the polynomial coefficients through a generating function. This design allows the same mathematical foundation to support both scientific investigation and generative algorithmic art. The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials. The method was applied to the cubic polynomial system to analyze its bifurcation structure, demonstrating its value as both a scientific tool for exploring root phenomena and an educational aid for visualizing fundamental concepts in algebra and dynamical systems. Beyond analysis, the Polynomiogram also demonstrated its potential as a tool for personalized generative art.

However, many libraries are not designed with composition in mind and assume they have exclusive access to all resources. Using such libraries concurrently can result in contention and degraded performance. Prior solutions involve modifying the libraries or the OS, which is often infeasible.\n  We propose Virtual Library Contexts (VLCs), which are process subunits that encapsulate sets of libraries and associated resource allocations. VLCs control the resource utilization of these libraries without modifying library code. This enables the user to partition resources between libraries to prevent contention, or load multiple copies of the same library to allow parallel execution of otherwise thread-unsafe code within the same process.\n  In this paper, we describe and evaluate C++ and Python prototypes of VLCs. Experiments show VLCs enable a speedup up to 2.85x on benchmarks including applications using OpenMP, OpenBLAS, and LibTorch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e76\u884c\u673a\u5668\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e93\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6765\u5c01\u88c5\u548c\u5229\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u5e93\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u672a\u8003\u8651\u5230\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5047\u5b9a\u53ef\u4ee5\u72ec\u5360\u6240\u6709\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e93\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u4e89\u7528\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6d89\u53ca\u4fee\u6539\u5e93\u6216\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u5e93\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08VLCs\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u5c01\u88c5\u5e93\u548c\u5173\u8054\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b50\u5355\u5143\u3002VLCs\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u5e93\u4ee3\u7801\u5c31\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e93\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5e93\u4e4b\u95f4\u5212\u5206\u8d44\u6e90\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u4e89\u7528\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a0\u8f7d\u591a\u4e2a\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5e93\u4ee5\u5141\u8bb8\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u539f\u672c\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63cf\u8ff0\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86C++\u548cPython\u7684VLCs\u539f\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4f7f\u7528OpenMP\u3001OpenBLAS\u548cLibTorch\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cVLCs\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe2.85\u500d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e76\u884c\u673a\u5668\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u9700\u8981\u7ec4\u5408\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e93\u4ee5\u5c01\u88c5\u548c\u5229\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u5e93\u672a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u7ec4\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5b83\u4eec\u72ec\u5360\u6240\u6709\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8d44\u6e90\u4e89\u7528\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4fee\u6539\u5e93\u6216\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u5e93\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08VLCs\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u5e93\u4ee3\u7801\u5373\u53ef\u5c01\u88c5\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5e93\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u3002VLCs\u4f7f\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u591f\u5212\u5206\u8d44\u6e90\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u5e93\u95f4\u4e89\u7528\uff0c\u6216\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a0\u8f7d\u591a\u4e2a\u76f8\u540c\u5e93\u4ee5\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u539f\u672c\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5728C++\u548cPython\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86VLCs\u5728\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528OpenMP\u3001OpenBLAS\u548cLibTorch\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe2.85\u500d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "VLCs\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u5e93\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a7\u5236\u5e93\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u8d44\u6e90\u4e89\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e76\u884c\u673a\u5668\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We highlight two recurring limitations in much of the current literature: (i) rule based (deontological) methods that encode duties as constraints or shields often struggle under ambiguity and nonstationarity and do not cultivate lasting habits, and (ii) many reward based approaches, especially single objective RL, implicitly compress diverse moral considerations into a single scalar signal, which can obscure trade offs and invite proxy gaming in practice. We instead treat ethics as policy level dispositions, that is, relatively stable habits that hold up when incentives, partners, or contexts change. This shifts evaluation beyond rule checks or scalar returns toward trait summaries, durability under interventions, and explicit reporting of moral trade offs. Our roadmap combines four components: (1) social learning in multi agent RL to acquire virtue like patterns from imperfect but normatively informed exemplars; (2) multi objective and constrained formulations that preserve value conflicts and incorporate risk aware criteria to guard against harm; (3) affinity based regularization toward updateable virtue priors that support trait like stability under distribution shift while allowing norms to evolve; and (4) operationalizing diverse ethical traditions as practical control signals, making explicit the value and cultural assumptions that shape ethical RL benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u4f26\u7406\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ee5\u7f8e\u5fb7\u4e3a\u91cd\u70b9\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5b83\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6cd5\u628a\u591a\u79cd\u9053\u5fb7\u8003\u91cf\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4e60\u60ef\u6027\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5e26\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u7f8e\u5fb7\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u4f26\u7406\u4f20\u7edf\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u4f26\u7406\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u7684\u503e\u5411\u548c\u4e60\u60ef\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1. \u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u5b66\u4e60 2. \u591a\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5e26\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8868\u8ff0 3. \u57fa\u4e8e\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7f8e\u5fb7 4. \u5c06\u5404\u79cd\u4f26\u7406\u4f20\u7edf\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u6ca1\u6709\u5177\u4f53\u63d0\u53ca\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9884\u671f\u6548\u679c\uff1a\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6fc0\u52b1\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u4f26\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e94\u66f4\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u9053\u5fb7\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u6587\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u660e\u786e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4f26\u7406\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Generating a PoV input requires solving two sets of constraints: (1) reachability constraints for reaching vulnerable code locations, and (2) triggering constraints for activating the target vulnerability. Existing approaches, including directed greybox fuzzing and LLM-assisted fuzzing, struggle to efficiently satisfy these constraints. This work presents an agentic method that mimics human experts. Human analysts iteratively study code to extract semantic reachability and triggering constraints, form hypotheses about PoV triggering strategies, encode them as test inputs, and refine their understanding using debugging feedback. We automate this process with an agentic directed fuzzing framework called PBFuzz. PBFuzz tackles four challenges in agentic PoV generation: autonomous code reasoning for semantic constraint extraction, custom program-analysis tools for targeted inference, persistent memory to avoid hypothesis drift, and property-based testing for efficient constraint solving while preserving input structure. Experiments on the Magma benchmark show strong results. PBFuzz triggered 57 vulnerabilities, surpassing all baselines, and uniquely triggered 17 vulnerabilities not exposed by existing fuzzers. PBFuzz achieved this within a 30-minute budget per target, while conventional approaches use 24 hours. Median time-to-exposure was 339 seconds for PBFuzz versus 8680 seconds for AFL++ with CmpLog, giving a 25.6x efficiency improvement with an API cost of 1.83 USD per vulnerability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We conducted a comparative pilot study of three state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3 8B) by prompting them to implement a standardized Book Lending Microservice under strict Hexagonal Architecture constraints. Utilizing Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing, we find that while proprietary models achieve high architectural conformance (0% violation rate for GPT-5.1), open-weights models exhibit critical divergence. Specifically, Llama 3 demonstrated an 80% Architectural Violation Rate, frequently bypassing interface adapters to create illegal circular dependencies between Domain and Infrastructure layers. Furthermore, we identified a phenomenon of \"Implementation Laziness,\" where open-weights models generated 60% fewer Logical Lines of Code (LLOC) than their proprietary counterparts, effectively omitting complex business logic to satisfy token constraints.

Yet despite rapid progress in code generation, today's Large Language Models (LLMs) are rarely tested on this kind of forward-looking reasoning. We close that gap with gpuFLOPBench, a benchmark that asks models to \"count without running\" by predicting single and double-precision FLOP counts for 577 CUDA kernels drawn from HeCBench, annotated with ground-truth profiles and eight execution attributes that distinguish trivially analyzable code from kernels whose FLOPs depend on hidden compiler or runtime behavior. Evaluating current closed-source reasoning models shows clear but uneven progress: the newest LLMs achieve perfect classification on straightforward kernels but still incur multiple order-of-magnitude errors whenever implicit FLOPs arise from division, intrinsic math functions, or common subexpressions. These results surface a core limitation of existing code assistants -- the inability to internalize hardware-specific microcode effects -- and position gpuFLOPBench as a focused testbed for developing LLM tooling that can reason about performance with the same rigor as experienced GPU developers.

Here we introduce a geometric framework in which all psychometric batteries for AI agents are treated as points in a structured moduli space, and agent performance is described by capability functionals over this space. First, we define an Autonomous AI (AAI) Scale, a Kardashev-style hierarchy of autonomy grounded in measurable performance on batteries spanning families of tasks (for example reasoning, planning, tool use and long-horizon control). Second, we construct a moduli space of batteries, identifying equivalence classes of benchmarks that are indistinguishable at the level of agent orderings and capability inferences. This geometry yields determinacy results: dense families of batteries suffice to certify performance on entire regions of task space. Third, we introduce a general Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator that subsumes reinforcement learning, self-play, debate and verifier-based fine-tuning as special cases, and we define a self-improvement coefficient $\u03ba$ as the Lie derivative of a capability functional along the induced flow. A variance inequality on the combined noise of generation and verification provides sufficient conditions for $\u03ba> 0$.

Yet, large-scale repositories inevitably introduce noisy or mislabeled examples that degrade both accuracy and robustness. While Noise Label Learning (NLL) has been extensively studied in other fields, there are a few works that investigate NLL in Software Engineering (SE) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for SE tasks. In this work, we propose MANTRA, a Multi-stage Adaptive Noise TReAtment framework that embeds noise diagnosis and mitigation directly into the fine-tuning process of code-Pretrained Language Models (PTM) and code-LLMs. We first investigate the effect of noise at varying levels on convergence and loss trajectories of the models. Then we apply an adaptive dropout strategy guided by per-sample loss dynamics and Gaussian Mixture Model clustering to exclude persistently noisy points while preserving clean data. Applying to code summarization and commit intent classification, our experiments reveal that some LLMs are more sensitive to noise than others. However, with MANTRA, the performance of all models in both tasks is improved. MANTRA enables researchers and practitioners to reduce the impact of errors introduced by the dataset in training, saves time in data cleaning and processing, while maximizing the effect of fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper provides the first comprehensive third party cryptanalysis of Gleeok-128.

First, most fuzzers use optimization pipelines (heuristics-based, fixed sequences of passes) as their harness. The phase-ordering problem can enable or preempt transformations, so pipelines inevitably miss optimization interactions; moreover, many optimizations are not scheduled, even at aggressive levels. Second, optimizations typically fire only when inputs satisfy specific structural relationships, which existing generators and mutations struggle to produce. We propose targeted fuzzing of individual optimizations to complement pipeline-based testing. Our key idea is to exploit composition styles - structural relations over program constructs (adjacency, nesting, repetition, ordering) - that optimizations look for. We build a general-purpose, grammar-based mutational fuzzer, TargetFuzz, that (i) mines composition styles from an optimization-relevant corpus, then (ii) rebuilds them inside different contexts offered by a larger, generic corpus via synthesized mutations to test variations of optimization logic. TargetFuzz is adaptable to a new programming language by lightweight, grammar-based, construct annotations - and it automatically synthesizes mutators and crossovers to rebuild composition styles. No need for hand-coded generators or language-specific mutators, which is particularly useful for modular frameworks such as MLIR, whose dialect-based, rapidly evolving ecosystem makes optimizations difficult to fuzz. Our evaluation on LLVM and MLIR shows that TargetFuzz improves coverage by 8% and 11% and triggers optimizations 2.8$\\times$ and 2.6$\\times$, compared to baseline fuzzers under the targeted fuzzing mode.

Dense reward functions, which provide informative feedback at every step or state transition, offer a potential solution by shaping agent behavior and accelerating learning. Despite their benefits, poorly crafted reward functions can lead to unintended behaviors, reward hacking, or inefficient exploration. This problem is particularly acute in complex or high-dimensional environments where handcrafted rewards are difficult to specify and validate. To address this, recent research has explored a variety of approaches, including inverse reinforcement learning, reward modeling from human preferences, and self-supervised learning of intrinsic rewards.

Our analysis uncovers a critical diversity trap: under standard unbiased aggregation, the convergence error floor is driven by the harmonic mean of subcarrier SNRs. Consequently, a single spectral hole caused by severe beam squint can render the entire bandwidth useless for reliable model updates. We further identify a fundamental bandwidth limit, revealing that expanding the spectrum beyond a critical point degrades convergence due to the integration of thermal noise and gain collapse at band edges. Finally, we demonstrate that an SNR-weighted aggregation strategy is necessary to suppress the variance singularity at these spectral holes, effectively recovering convergence in high-squint regimes where standard averaging fails.

It underpins anomaly detection, failure diagnosis, and other AIOps tasks. Current parsers are mostly reactive and log-centric. They only infer templates from logs, mostly overlooking the source code. This restricts their capacity to grasp dynamic log structures or adjust to evolving systems. Moreover, per-log LLM inference is too costly for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose LLM-SrcLog, a proactive and unified framework for log template parsing. It extracts templates directly from source code prior to deployment and supplements them with data-driven parsing for logs without available code. LLM-SrcLog integrates a cross-function static code analyzer to reconstruct meaningful logging contexts, an LLM-based white-box template extractor with post-processing to distinguish constants from variables, and a black-box template extractor that incorporates data-driven clustering for remaining unmatched logs. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Hadoop and Zookeeper) and a large-scale industrial system (Sunfire-Compute) show that, compared to two LLM-based baselines, LLM-SrcLog improves average F1-score by 2-17% and 8-35%. Meanwhile, its online parsing latency is comparable to data-driven methods and about 1,000 times faster than per-log LLM parsing. LLM-SrcLog achieves a near-ideal balance between speed and accuracy. Finally, we further validate the effectiveness of LLM-SrcLog through practical case studies in a real-world production environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

From the data perspective, we introduce semantic entropy-guided curriculum learning, organizing training data from low to high semantic entropy to guide progressive optimization from easier to more challenging tasks. For the algorithmic design, we adopt non-uniform token treatment by imposing KL regularization on low-entropy tokens that critically impact policy exploration and applying stronger constraints on high-covariance portions within these tokens.

However, existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically treat code as plain natural language, relying primarily on shallow semantic matching while overlooking structural semantics and code-specific dependencies. This limits their ability to capture control flow and underlying intent, ultimately constraining the quality of generated code. Therefore, we propose CoCo, a novel framework that enables code Completion by Comprehension of multi-granularity context from large-scale code repositories. CoCo employs static code analysis to extract structured context at the function, file, and project levels, capturing execution logic and semantic dependencies. It then adopts an graph-based multi-granularity context selection mechanism to filter out redundant information and remove noise. Consequently, the information is converted into natural language in a consistent manner, thereby functioning as explicit contextual prompts to guide subsequent code completion. Additionally, a structure-aware code re-ranker mechanism ensures alignment at both semantic and structural levels. Extensive experiments on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 20.2% gains in EM.

In this paper, we present AgentBay, a novel sandbox service designed from the ground up for hybrid interaction. AgentBay provides secure, isolated execution environments spanning Windows, Linux, Android, Web Browsers, and Code interpreters. Its core contribution is a unified session accessible via a hybrid control interface: An AI agent can interact programmatically via mainstream interfaces (MCP, Open Source SDK), while a human operator can, at any moment, seamlessly take over full manual control. This seamless intervention is enabled by Adaptive Streaming Protocol (ASP). Unlike traditional VNC/RDP, ASP is specifically engineered for this hybrid use case, delivering an ultra-low-latency, smoother user experience that remains resilient even in weak network environments. It achieves this by dynamically blending command-based and video-based streaming, adapting its encoding strategy based on network conditions and the current controller (AI or human). Our evaluation demonstrates strong results in security, performance, and task completion rates. In a benchmark of complex tasks, the AgentBay (Agent + Human) model achieved more than 48% success rate improvement. Furthermore, our ASP protocol reduces bandwidth consumption by up to 50% compared to standard RDP, and in end-to-end latency with around 5% reduction, especially under poor network conditions.

While prior work has evaluated language models on data-sharing scenarios based on general privacy norms, we focus on personalizing language models' privacy decisions, grounding their judgments directly in prior user privacy decisions. Our findings suggest that general privacy norms are insufficient for effective personalization of privacy decisions. Furthermore, we find that eliciting privacy judgments from the model through In-context Learning (ICL) is unreliable to due misalignment with the user's prior privacy judgments and opaque reasoning traces, which make it difficult for the user to interpret the reasoning behind the model's decisions. To address these limitations, we propose ARIEL (Agentic Reasoning with Individualized Entailment Logic), a framework that jointly leverages a language model and rule-based logic for structured data-sharing reasoning. ARIEL is based on formulating personalization of data sharing as an entailment, whether a prior user judgment on a data-sharing request implies the same judgment for an incoming request. Our experimental evaluations on advanced models and publicly-available datasets demonstrate that ARIEL can reduce the F1 score error by $\\textbf{39.1%}$ over language model-based reasoning (ICL), demonstrating that ARIEL is effective at correctly judging requests where the user would approve data sharing.

These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs.

Recent discussions on Self-Adaptation 2.0 emphasize an equal partnership between AI and adaptive systems, merging learning-driven intelligence with adaptive control for predictive and proactive behavior. Building on this foundation, we introduce POLARIS, a three-layer multi-agentic self-adaptation framework that advances beyond reactive adaptation.

Through shared knowledge and predictive models, POLARIS handles uncertainty, learns from past actions, and evolves its strategies, enabling systems that anticipate change and maintain resilient, goal-directed behavior. Preliminary evaluation on two self-adaptive exemplars, SWIM and SWITCH, shows that POLARIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Through rigorous theoretical analysis based on Markov models, we establish that the root cause lies in greedy decoding's inability to escape repetitive loops, exacerbated by self-reinforcement effects.\n  Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates three viable solutions: (1) Beam Search decoding with early_stopping=True serves as a universal post-hoc mechanism that effectively resolves all three repetition patterns; (2) presence_penalty hyperparameter provides an effective solution specifically for BadCase 1; and (3) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fine-tuning offers a universal model-level solution for all three BadCases.\n  The primary value of this work lies in combining first-hand production experience with extensive experimental validation. Our main contributions include systematic theoretical analysis of repetition mechanisms, comprehensive evaluation of multiple solutions with task-specific applicability mapping, identification of early_stopping as the critical parameter for Beam Search effectiveness, and practical production-ready solutions validated in real deployment environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u91cd\u590d\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u4f1a\u751f\u6210\u91cd\u590d\u5185\u5bb9\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u7ec8\u6b62\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u79cd\u91cd\u590d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Markov\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1aBeam Search\u89e3\u7801\u3001presence_penalty\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3001DPO\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u751f\u4ea7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unfortunately, configuring Kubernetes is prone to errors. Configuration defects are not uncommon and can result in serious consequences. This paper reports an empirical study about configuration defects in Kubernetes with the goal of helping practitioners detect and prevent these defects. We study 719 defects that we extract from 2,260 Kubernetes configuration scripts using open source repositories. Using qualitative analysis, we identify 15 categories of defects. We find 8 publicly available static analysis tools to be capable of detecting 8 of the 15 defect categories. We find that the highest precision and recall of those tools are for defects related to data fields. We develop a linter to detect two categories of defects that cause serious consequences, which none of the studied tools are able to detect. Our linter revealed 26 previously-unknown defects that have been confirmed by practitioners, 19 of which have already been fixed. We conclude our paper by providing recommendations on how defect detection and repair techniques can be used for Kubernetes configuration scripts.

The demand for both automated approaches and deep integration of human insight makes this a challenging problem. We address this gap by proposing an approach to synthesise a FM task-specific evaluator program that provides automation and a custom UI for capturing feedback. The core novelty of our approach lies in: (1) a task-agnostic meta-model that captures properties of any FM task, (2) an interaction protocol for efficient use of human feedback, and (3) an eval synthesiser that selects or generates an appropriate set of evals. We implement our approach in \\toolname and demonstrate the concept on two diverse FM tasks: chart data extraction and document question answering. A preliminary evaluation on the quality of our selected evals shows 93\\% and 90\\% accuracy respectively.

This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the \"FAGNER Paradox\" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the \"Lukaku Paradox\", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction.

Finally, the chapter examines ethical questions that arise specifically from generative AI's mimetic generativity, such as debates about authorship and credit, the emergence of as-if social relationships with machines, and new forms of influence, persuasion, and manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7ae0\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6280\u672f\u5165\u95e8\u3001\u5728AI\u4f26\u7406\u4e2d\u52a0\u5267\u6216\u51cf\u8f7b\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7279\u6709\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c06\u6280\u672f\u89c6\u4f5c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u54f2\u5b66\u4f26\u7406\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u5165\u95e8\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u548c\u7279\u6709\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u4f26\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5bf9\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u5f02\u5316\u548c\u5265\u524a\u7b49\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5176\u6a21\u4eff\u751f\u6210\u6027\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u4fe1\u7528\u548c\u673a\u5668\u793e\u4ea4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7ae0\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4f26\u7406\u6311\u6218\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u54f2\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

A number of recent studies have demonstrated convincing reconstruction of intelligible speech from surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical recordings by predicting a series of phonemes or words and using downstream language models to obtain meaningful sentences. A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings. In particular, optimizing neural decoders becomes critical in this case. Here we present an offline speech decoding pipeline based on an encoder-decoder deep neural architecture, integrating Vision Transformers and contrastive learning to enhance the direct regression of speech from ECoG signals. The approach is evaluated on two datasets, one obtained with clinical subdural electrodes in an epileptic patient, and another obtained with the fully implantable WIMAGINE epidural system in a participant of a motor BCI trial.

However, these methods rely on a costly gradient orthogonalization step. Even efficient iterative approximations such as Newton-Schulz remain expensive, typically requiring dozens of matrix multiplications to converge. We introduce a preconditioning procedure that accelerates Newton-Schulz convergence and reduces its computational cost. We evaluate its impact and show that the overhead of our preconditioning can be made negligible. Furthermore, the faster convergence it enables allows us to remove one iteration out of the usual five without degrading approximation quality. Our publicly available implementation achieves up to a 2.8x speedup in the Newton-Schulz approximation. We also show that this has a direct impact on end-to-end training runtime with 5-10% improvement in realistic training scenarios across two efficiency-focused tasks. On challenging language or vision tasks, we validate that our method maintains equal or superior model performance while improving runtime. Crucially, these improvements require no hyperparameter tuning and can be adopted as a simple drop-in replacement.

Indeed, although this capability is readily handled by rule-based symbolic systems based on serial computation, learning to systematically deploy counting procedures is difficult for neural models, which should acquire these skills through learning. Previous research has demonstrated that recurrent architectures can only approximately track and enumerate sequences of events, and it remains unclear whether modern deep learning systems, including LLMs, can deploy systematic counting procedures over sequences of discrete symbols. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the sequential enumeration abilities of five state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning models. We probe LLMs in sequential naming and production tasks involving lists of letters and words, adopting a variety of prompting instructions to explore the role of chain-of-thought in the spontaneous emerging of counting strategies. We also evaluate open-source models with the same architecture but increasing size to see whether the mastering of counting principles follows scaling laws, and we analyze the embedding dynamics during sequential enumeration to investigate the emergent encoding of numerosity. We find that some LLMs are indeed capable of deploying counting procedures when explicitly prompted to do so, but none of them spontaneously engage in counting when simply asked to enumerate the number of items in a sequence. Our results suggest that, despite their impressive emergent abilities, LLMs cannot yet robustly and systematically deploy counting procedures, highlighting a persistent gap between neural and symbolic approaches to compositional generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4e94\u79cdLLMs\u80fd\u5426\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9700\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u624d\u80fd\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u4e0d\u53ca\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u6570\u80fd\u529b\u6b20\u7f3a\uff0cLLMs\u80fd\u5426\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b64\u529f\u80fd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e94\u79cdLLMs\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

In a nutshell, XIL algorithms select a number of items on which an AI model made a decision (e.g. images and their tags) and present them to users, together with corresponding explanations (e.g. image regions that drive the model's decision). Then, users supply corrective feedback for the explanations, which the algorithm uses to improve the model. Despite showing promise in debugging tasks, recent studies have raised concerns that explanatory interaction may trigger order effects, a well-known cognitive bias in which the sequence of presented items influences users' trust and, critically, the quality of their feedback. We argue that these studies are not entirely conclusive, as the experimental designs and tasks employed differ substantially from common XIL use cases, complicating interpretation. To clarify the interplay between order effects and explanatory interaction, we ran two larger-scale user studies (n = 713 total) designed to mimic common XIL tasks. Specifically, we assessed order effects both within and between debugging sessions by manipulating the order in which correct and wrong explanations are presented to participants. Order effects had a limited, through significant impact on users' agreement with the model (i.e., a behavioral measure of their trust), and only when examined withing debugging sessions, not between them. The quality of users' feedback was generally satisfactory, with order effects exerting only a small and inconsistent influence in both experiments. Overall, our findings suggest that order effects do not pose a significant issue for the successful employment of XIL approaches.

Although relevant to areas such as cryptography, crystallography, and medical imaging, the problem remains unresolved: beyond a few special dimensions, neither optimal packings nor tight upper bounds are known. Even a major breakthrough in dimension $n=8$, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precision semidefinite programs (SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combines Bayesian optimisation with Monte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions $4-16$, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528AI\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u7403\u5806\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e0a\u754c", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7403\u5806\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5178\u578b\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u5c06\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212(SDP)\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22", "result": "\u57284-16\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u6700\u4f18\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1AI\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u683c\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f"}}

Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time.

However, current evaluation frameworks may inadequately assess their effectiveness as research collaborators. This rapid review examines benchmarking practices for AI systems in preclinical biomedical research. Three major databases and two preprint servers were searched from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2025, identifying 14 benchmarks that assess AI capabilities in literature understanding, experimental design, and hypothesis generation. The results revealed that all current benchmarks assess isolated component capabilities, including data analysis quality, hypothesis validity, and experimental protocol design. However, authentic research collaboration requires integrated workflows spanning multiple sessions, with contextual memory, adaptive dialogue, and constraint propagation.

Existing prompting strategies rely on static correlations rather than generative interpretations of dynamic behavior, lacking critical global and instance-specific context. To address this, we propose STELLA (Semantic-Temporal Alignment with Language Abstractions), a framework that systematically mines and injects structured supplementary and complementary information. STELLA employs a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decouples input series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It then translates intrinsic behavioral features of these components into Hierarchical Semantic Anchors: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) for global context and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) for instance-level patterns. Using these anchors as prefix-prompts, STELLA guides the LLM to model intrinsic dynamics. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that STELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long- and short-term forecasting, showing superior generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our dynamically generated semantic anchors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSTELLA\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faSTELLA\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "STELLA\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u548c\u6b8b\u4f59\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u2018\u5206\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\u2019\u3002\u8be5\u951a\u70b9\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u5c42\uff1a\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c(CSP)\u548c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a(FBP)\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSTELLA\u5728\u957f\u671f\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7ablation\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "STELLA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3aLLMs\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
